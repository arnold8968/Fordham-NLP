            "Mistress Adrienne, I have been given a bed with a pink dresser <br>In the hothouse <br>Joining the Concord Public Library: the walls and roof are <br>Glass and my privacy comes from the apple-geraniums, <br>Violets, ferns, marigolds, and white mayflags. <br>I get my meals <br>With the janitor and his wife and all of the books are mine <br>To use. I scour, sweep, and dust. <br>I hope you don’t think of me <br>As a runaway? I remember your kindness, <br>Your lessons in reading and writing on the piazza. <br>My journey was unusual. I saw some of the war <br>And it was terrible even far up into the North. <br>My first fright was at a train depot outside Memphis <br>Where some soldiers found me eating not yet ripened   <br>Quinces and grapes, they took me prisoner: first <br>I helped some children carry tree limbs to the woodbox <br>Of the locomotive, then, I was shown to a gentleman <br>In the passenger car who was searching for his runaway <br>Negress in a purple dress; he wouldn’t identify me, <br><br>And I was thrown in with about forty stray blacks into <br>An open boxcar and soon we were moving, next to me <br>A man was sucking on the small breasts of a girl <br>Maybe twelve years of age, across from them <br>A sad old woman smiled as she puffed on an old cigar end, <br>By afternoon she was dead, her two friends <br>Just kicked her out so that she rolled down into pasture <br>Frightening some hogs that ran off into a thicket. <br>The girl next to me whimpered and shook. Those quinces <br>Just ran straight through me and all I could do was <br>Squat in one corner that was supplied with ammonia-waters <br>And hay. We were given that night Confederate uniforms <br>To mend and when the others slept I dressed in three <br>Shirts and trousers and leapt from the moving train, <br>The padding helped some but I couldn’t walk the next day. <br>I hid in a shack that seemed lonely but for a flock <br>Of turkeys, some young hens, and a corncrib with tall <br>Split palings. The next morning from a hill <br>I watched field-workers on a tobacco plantation, it took <br>Two men to carry a single leaf like a corpse from <br>A battle scene. That night I found a horse with a bit <br>In its mouth made of telegraph wire. He carried me up all <br>The way to Youngstown. <em>Chloe, you must <br>Learn to swim in the pond and to ride the old sorrel.</em> <br>I am grateful. I had to swim two rivers. I fished some <br>For perch, bream, and trout and ate dried berries.   <br>I stole a bushel of oysters from the porch of a farmhouse. <br>I treated my sores with blackgum from poplars. I witnessed <br>The hanging of three Confederate soldiers at a trestle: <br>Once they were done dancing, they settled in their greatcoats <br>Like dead folded birds. I have a hatred <br>Of men and I walked away from the trestle singing. <br>I spoke to The Concord Literary Club last Tuesday <br>About my experiences. I told them you never did <br>Abuse me. How we would sit out in the gazebo <br>And listen to the boys with their violins, tambourines, <br>Bones, drums and sticks. How we wept as girls <br>When the fox bit the head off our peahen and that <br>From that day how the peacock, missing his mate, would <br>See her in his reflection in a downstairs window <br>And fly at it increasing his iridescence with lacerations. <br>When I left you the windows were all missing and daubers <br>Were making their mud houses in the high corners <br>Of the hallway. With sugar-water and crepe I have put a new <br>Hem on my purple dress. <br><br>At night I walk down the aisles <br>Of the library, the books climb twenty feet above me,   <br>I just walk there naked with my tiny lamp. <br>I have the need to fling the lamp sometimes: but I resist it. <br>Mistress Adrienne, I saw three big cities burning! <br>Did you know ladies from Philadelphia rode for two days <br>In wagons to climb a hill where with spyglasses they watched <br>The war like a horse-pulling contest at a fair. <br>The man beside me on the train who was sucking the little <br>Girl’s breasts, he was your stable boy, Napoleon. He said <br>He never had a bad word for you. His little mistress was <br>Still bare to the waist and before I leapt from the train, <br>And while he slept, I ran a rod into his eye. I stabbed him <br>In his brain. She stopped weeping. <br>Remember that French lullaby where two fleas in a gentleman’s <br>Mustache die like a kiss between the lips of the gentleman <br>And his mistress. How we laughed at it! <br>I hope you were not long unconscious there beside the pond. <br>I just ran away from you, listening the whole night <br>For your father’s hounds. I am <br>Afraid I split your parasol on your skull. If I <br>Don’t hear from you I will try to understand. <em>Chloe.</em><br><br>\n",

<br>Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.\" <br><br>         The men of wealthy Sestos every year, <br>For his sake whom their goddess held so dear, <br>Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast. <br>Thither resorted many a wandering guest <br>To meet their loves; such as had none at all <br>Came lovers home from this great festival; <br>For every street, like to a firmament, <br>Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went, <br>Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd <br>Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd <br>As if another Pha{\"e}ton had got <br>The guidance of the sun's rich chariot. <br>But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd, <br>And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind; <br>For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony, <br>So was her beauty to the standers-by; <br>Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star <br>(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car <br>From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky, <br>Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty, <br>She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood <br>Than she the hearts of those that near her stood. <br>Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase, <br>Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race, <br>Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain <br>From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain, <br>So ran the people forth to gaze upon her, <br>And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her. <br>And as in fury of a dreadful fight, <br>Their fellows being slain or put to flight, <br>Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken, <br>So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken, <br>Await the sentence of her scornful eyes; <br>He whom she favours lives; the other dies. <br>There might you see one sigh, another rage, <br>And some, their violent passions to assuage, <br>Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late, <br>For faithful love will never turn to hate. <br>And many, seeing great princes were denied, <br>Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died. <br>On this feast-day—O cursed day and hour!— <br>Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower <br>To Venus' temple, where unhappily, <br>As after chanc'd, they did each other spy. <br>So fair a church as this had Venus none: <br>The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone, <br>Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head <br>A lively vine of green sea-agate spread, <br>Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung, <br>And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung. <br>Of crystal shining fair the pavement was; <br>The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass: <br>There might you see the gods in sundry shapes, <br>Committing heady riots, incest, rapes: <br>For know, that underneath this radiant flower <br>Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower, <br>Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed, <br>To dally with Idalian Ganimed, <br>And for his love Europa bellowing loud, <br>And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud; <br>Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net, <br>Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set; <br>Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy, <br>Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy <br>That now is turn'd into a cypress tree, <br>Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be. <br>And in the midst a silver altar stood: <br>There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood, <br>Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close; <br>And modestly they opened as she rose. <br>Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head; <br>And thus Leander was enamoured. <br>Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed, <br>Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed <br>Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook: <br>Such force and virtue hath an amorous look. <br><br>         It lies not in our power to love or hate, <br>For will in us is over-rul'd by fate. <br>When two are stript, long ere the course begin, <br>We wish that one should lose, the other win; <br>And one especially do we affect <br>Of two gold ingots, like in each respect: <br>The reason no man knows, let it suffice, <br>What we behold is censur'd by our eyes. <br>Where both deliberate, the love is slight: <br>Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?

And the medicinal uses of herbs: Fenugreek opens up a<br>stuffy head; goldenseal lubricates the cracked mucous membranes.<br>Over a circa 1820 American dropleaf table, she told me asparagus<br>was the broom of the kidneys. I hadn't understood at first and<br>thought she'd used a German word I pictured as <em>brüm </em>and not as the<br>little stalks standing on their heads, sweeping out the impurities. I<br>learned to make the perfect roux for soufflé and became her<br>efficient assistant in the kitchen—dicing and chopping, she once<br>told me, with unparalleled patience. Then one day she began to<br>accidentally break my Depression glassware, and I recalled how<br>she'd giggled when she told me that in two years of marriage she<br>had single-handedly decimated her husband's glass collection<br>dating from 1790 to 1810, including a rare wedding goblet. In the<br>doorway to the back porch she stated simply that my presence<br>made her feel strangled, it was nothing I was doing or could do. We<br>saw a therapist for six years, while my collection dwindled then<br>became memory. With unparalleled patience I jumped through<br>hoop after burning hoop, the therapist pointed out, but I heard that<br>as praise for my prowess and continued to balance Bauer plates on<br>my nose on command; hold growling tigers off with Windsor dining<br>room chairs; juggle career, job, hope, and nightly tempests with<br>unparalleled dexterity. I could reassemble anything: shattered pictures<br>of us crossing the street with canes in the future, my hand under her<br>elbow. My heart. But what I lacked, I can see now, was the ability<br>to dissemble. Finally, she brought home a Cuisinart food processor,<br>and I started hearing the minutes slicing away with ferocious velocity,<br>time doing its soft-shoe faster and faster like Fred Astaire on<br>amphetamines. Memories of flowers and herbs were sacrificed to<br>the angry god of its vortex. Your voice is like acid on my skin, she<br>said after twelve years, then grabbed her Cuisinart and left me<br>behind like so much history.</p>\n",

No, it's worse.   <br><br>Why on earth did she find him so attractive   <br>the first time she met him, propping the wall   <br>at an awkward party, clearly trying to drink   <br>himself into some sort of conversation?   <br>Was it the dark uncomfortable reserve   <br>she took upon herself to tease him out of,   <br>asking, Are you a vampire? <em>That depends</em>,   <br>he stammered, <em>are you a virgin?</em> No, not funny,   <br>but why did she laugh at him? What made her think   <br>that he needed her, that she could teach him something?   <br>Why did she let him believe she was drunk   <br>and needed a ride home?

But the fact   <br>was more fantastic, a fairy-tale adventure   <br>where the wolf wins, and hides in the girl's red hood.   <br>How it happens she doesn't really remember,   <br>drifting off with a vague sense of being   <br>drawn out through a single point of her skin,   <br>like a bedsheet threaded through a needle's eye, <br>and bundled into a body that must be his.   <br><br>Sometimes she startles, as on the verge of sleep   <br>you can feel yourself fall backward over a brink,   <br>and snaps her eyelids open, to catch herself   <br>slipping out of the bed, her legs swinging   <br>over the edge, and feels the sudden sick   <br>split-screen impression of being for a second   <br>both she and her.   <br>                              What he does with her   <br>while she's asleep, she never really knows,   <br>flickers, only, conducted back in dreams:   <br>Walking in neighborhoods she doesn't know   <br>and wouldn't go to, overpasses, ragweed,   <br>cars dry-docked on cinderblocks, wolf-whistles,   <br>wanting to run away and yet her steps   <br>planted sure and defiant. Performing tasks   <br>too odd to recognize and too mundane   <br>to have made up, like fixing a green salad   <br>with the sunflower seeds and peppers that she hates,   <br>pouring on twice the oil and vinegar   <br>that she would like, and being unable to stop.   <br>Her hands feel but are somehow not her own,   <br>running over the racks of stacked fabric   <br>in a clothing store, stroking the slick silk,   <br>teased cotton and polar fleece, as if her fingers   <br>each were a tongue tasting the knits and weaves.   <br>Harmless enough.   <br>                              It's what she doesn't dream   <br>that scares her, panic she can't account for, faces   <br>familiar but not known, déjà vu   <br>making a mess of memory, coming to   <br>with a fresh love-bite on her left breast   <br>and the aftershock of granting another's flesh,   <br>of having gripped, slipped in and fluttered tender   <br>mmm, unbraided, and spent the whole slow day   <br>clutching her thighs to keep the chafe from fading,   <br>and furious at being joyful, less   <br>at the violation, less the danger, than the sense   <br>he'd taken her enjoyment for his own.   <br>That was the time before, the time she swore   <br>would be the last—returning to her senses,   <br>she'd grabbed his throat and hit him around the face   <br>and threw him out, and sat there on the floor   <br>shaking. She hadn't known how hard it was   <br>to throw a punch without pulling it back.   <br><br>Now, as they sit together on her couch   <br>with the liquid cooling in the stained chipped cups   <br>that would never match, no matter how hard   <br>she stared at them, he seems the same as ever,   <br>a quiet clumsy self-effacing ghost   <br>with the gray-circled eyes that she once wanted   <br>so badly to defy, that seemed to see her   <br>seeing him—and she has to admit, she's missed him.   <br>Why? She scrolls back through their conversations,   <br>searching for any reason not to hate him.   <br>She'd ask him, What's it like being a girl   <br>when you're not a girl? His answers, when he gave them,   <br>weren't helpful, so evasively poetic:   <br><em>It's like a sponge somebody else is squeezing. <br>A radio tuned to all stations at once. <br>Like having skin that's softer but more thick. </em> <br><br>Then she remembers the morning she awoke   <br>with the smear of tears still raw across her cheeks   <br>and the spent feeling of having cried herself   <br>down to the bottom of something. Why was I crying?   <br>she asked, and he looked back blankly, with that little   <br>curve of a lip that served him for a smile.   <br><em>Because I can't. </em> <br>                              And that would be their secret.   <br>The power to feel another appetite   <br>pass through her, like a shudder, like a cold   <br>lungful of oxygen or hot sweet smoke,   <br>fill her and then be stilled. The freedom to fall   <br>asleep behind the blinds of his dark body   <br>and wake cleanly. And when she swings her legs   <br>over the edge of the bed, to trust her feet   <br>to hit the carpet, and know as not before   <br>how she never quite trusted the floor   <br>to be there, no, not since she was a girl   <br>first learning to swim, hugging her skinny   <br>breastless body close to the pool-gutter,   <br>skirting along the dark and darker blue   <br>of the bottom dropping out— <br>                              Now she can stand,   <br>and take the cup out of his giving hand,   <br>and feel what they have learned inside each other   <br>fair and enough, and not without a kind   <br>of satisfaction, that she can put her foot   <br>down, clear to the bottom of desire,   <br>and find that it can stop, and go no deeper.<br><br>\n",

And of course I was going to change,   <br> But freedom means that only aspects ever really change,   <br> And that as the past recedes and the future floats away<br> You turn into what you are. And so I stayed basically the same   <br> As what I’d always been, while the blond light in the trees   <br> Became part of my memory, and my voice took on the accents   <br> Of a mind infatuated with the rhetoric of farewell.<br><br> And now that disembodied grief has gone away.   <br> It was a flickering, literary kind of sadness,<br> The suspension of a life between two other lives   <br> Of continual remembrance, between two worlds<br> In which there’s too much solitude, too much disdain.   <br> But the sadness that I felt was real sadness,   <br> And this elation now a real tremor as the deepening   <br> Shadows lengthen upon the lake. This calm is real,   <br> But how much of the real past can it absorb?   <br> How far into the future can this peace extend?<br><br> I love the way the light falls over the suburbs<br> Late on these summer evenings, as the buried minds   <br> Stir in their graves, the hearts swell in the warm earth   <br> And the soul settles from the air into its human home.   <br> This is where the prodigal began, and now his day is ending   <br> In a great dream of contentment, where all night long   <br> The children sleep within tomorrow’s peaceful arms<br> And the past is still, and suddenly we turn around and smile   <br> At the memory of a vast, inchoate dream of happiness,   <br> Now that we know that none of it is ever going to be.<br><br> Don’t you remember how free the future seemed<br> When it was all imagination? It was a beautiful park<br> Where the sky was a page of water, and when we looked up,   <br> There were our own faces, shimmering in the clear air.   <br> And I know that this life is the only real form of happiness,   <br> But sometimes in its midst I can hear the dense, stifled sob   <br> Of the unreal one we might have known, and when that ends   <br> And my eyes are filled with tears, time seems to have stopped   <br> And we are alone in the park where it is almost twenty years ago   <br> And the future is still an immense, open dream.<br><br>\n",

Howsoe’er, my man <br>Shall read a piece of Virgil, Tacitus, <br>Livy, or of some better book to us, <br>Of which we’ll speak our minds, amidst our meat; <br>And I’ll profess no verses to repeat. <br>To this, if ought appear which I not know of, <br>That will the pastry, not my paper, show of.<br>Digestive cheese and fruit there sure will be; <br>But that which most doth take my Muse and me, <br>Is a pure cup of rich Canary wine, <br>Which is the Mermaid’s now, but shall be mine; <br>Of which had Horace, or Anacreon tasted, <br>Their lives, as so their lines, till now had lasted. <br>Tobacco, nectar, or the Thespian spring, <br>Are all but Luther's beer to this I sing. <br>Of this we will sup free, but moderately, <br>And we will have no Pooley, or Parrot by, <br>Nor shall our cups make any guilty men; <br>But, at our parting we will be as when <br>We innocently met. No simple word <br>That shall be uttered at our mirthful board, <br>Shall make us sad next morning or affright <br>The liberty that we’ll enjoy tonight.<br><br>\n",

<br>And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? <br>And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul? <br>And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul? <br><br><strong>2</strong> <br>The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account, <br>That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect. <br><br>The expression of the face balks account, <br>But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face, <br>It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists, <br>It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him, <br>The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth, <br>To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more, <br>You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side. <br><br>The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, <br>The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water, <br>The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle, <br>Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances, <br>The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting, <br>The female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard, <br>The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd, <br>The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work, <br>The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, <br>The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes; <br>The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps, <br>The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert, <br>The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting; <br>Such-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child, <br>Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count. <br><br><strong>3</strong> <br>I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons, <br>And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons. <br><br>This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person, <br>The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners, <br>These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also, <br>He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome, <br>They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him, <br>They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love, <br>He drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face, <br>He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him, <br>When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang, <br>You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other. <br><br><strong>4</strong> <br>I have perceiv’d that to be with those I like is enough, <br>To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough, <br>To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, <br>To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then? <br>I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea. <br><br>There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well, <br>All things please the soul, but these please the soul well. <br><br><strong>5</strong> <br>This is the female form, <br>A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot, <br>It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, <br>I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, <br>Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed, <br>Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable, <br>Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused, <br>Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching, <br>Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice, <br>Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn, <br>Undulating into the willing and yielding day, <br>Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day. <br><br>This the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman, <br>This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. <br><br>Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest, <br>You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. <br><br>The female contains all qualities and tempers them, <br>She is in her place and moves with perfect balance, <br>She is all things duly veil’d, she is both passive and active, <br>She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. <br><br>As I see my soul reflected in Nature, <br>As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty, <br>See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see. <br><br><strong>6</strong> <br>The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place, <br>He too is all qualities, he is action and power, <br>The flush of the known universe is in him, <br>Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well, <br>The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him, <br>The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul, <br>Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself, <br>Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here, <br>(Where else does he strike soundings except here?) <br><br>The man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred, <br>No matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers’ gang? <br>Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf? <br>Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you, <br>Each has his or her place in the procession. <br><br>(All is a procession, <br>The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.) <br><br>Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant? <br>Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight? <br>Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts, <br>For you only, and not for him and her? <br><br><strong>7</strong> <br>A man’s body at auction, <br>(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,) <br>I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business. <br><br>Gentlemen look on this wonder, <br>Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it, <br>For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant, <br>For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll’d. <br><br>In this head the all-baffling brain, <br>In it and below it the makings of heroes. <br><br>Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve, <br>They shall be stript that you may see them. <br><br>Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, <br>Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs, <br>And wonders within there yet. <br><br>Within there runs blood, <br>The same old blood! the same red-running blood! <br>There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations, <br>(Do you think they are not there because they are not express’d in parlors and lecture-rooms?) <br><br>This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns, <br>In him the start of populous states and rich republics, <br>Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments. <br><br>How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries? <br>(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?) <br><br><strong>8</strong> <br>A woman’s body at auction, <br>She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers, <br>She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers. <br><br>Have you ever loved the body of a woman? <br>Have you ever loved the body of a man? <br>Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth? <br><br>If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred, <br>And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted, <br>And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face. <br><br>Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body? <br>For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves. <br><br><strong>9</strong> <br>O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you, <br>I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul, (and that they are the soul,) <br>I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and that they are my poems, <br>Man’s, woman’s, child’s, youth’s, wife’s, husband’s, mother’s, father’s, young man’s, young woman’s poems, <br>Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears, <br>Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids, <br>Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges, <br>Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, <br>Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue, <br>Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the chest, <br>Upper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones, <br>Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger, finger-joints, finger-nails, <br>Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side, <br>Ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone, <br>Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root, <br>Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above, <br>Leg fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg, <br>Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel; <br>All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body or of any one’s body, male or female, <br>The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean, <br>The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame, <br>Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity, <br>Womanhood, and all that is a woman, and the man that comes from woman, <br>The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and risings, <br>The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud, <br>Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming, <br>Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening, <br>The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes, <br>The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair, <br>The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body, <br>The circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out, <br>The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees, <br>The thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the marrow in the bones, <br>The exquisite realization of health; <br>O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul, <br>O I say now these are the soul!<br>\n",

            "The black kitten cries at her bowl<br><i>meek meek</i> and the gray one glowers<br> from the windowsill. My hand on the can<br> to serve them. First day of spring.<br> Yesterday I drove my little mother for hours<br> through wet snow. Her eightieth birthday.<br> What she wanted was that ride with me—<br> shopping, gossiping, mulling old grievances,<br> 1930, 1958, 1970.<br> How cruel the world has been to her,<br> how uncanny she’s survived it.<br> In her bag, a birthday card<br> from “my Nemesis,” signed <i>Sincerely<br> with love—</i>“Why is she doing this to me?”<br> she demands, “She <i>hates</i> me.”<br> “Maybe<br> she loves you” is and isn’t what Mother<br> wants to hear, maybe after sixty years<br> the connection might as well be love.<br><i>Might well be love,</i> I don’t say—<br> I won’t spoil her birthday,<br> my implacable mother.<br> In Byfield,<br> in the snowstorm, we bought things<br> at an antiques mall, she a miniature<br> Sunbonnet Baby creamer and saucer—<br> a bargain!—I, a chrome ice bucket<br> stamped with penguins, with Bakelite handles.<br> I wanted it, I had one just like it<br> at home. Sometimes I think the only thing<br> I’m sure I want is what I have.<br><br> “What do you wish for?” I asked<br> a friend, I was so curious to know<br> how he’d formulate a wish, to know<br> if there <i>is</i> a formula. His list<br> was deliciously simple, my friend<br> the hedonist: a penthouse with a concierge,<br> “wonderful food,” months in Mexico,<br> good movies . . . .<br><br> Last night, you and I<br> watched “The Way We Were” and I cried—<br> I always do—for the wanting in it,<br> and the losing. “It’s a great movie,”<br> I said, to justify my tears. I wish<br> you were more like me. Streisand and Redford,<br> so opposite it’s emblematic, almost<br> a cliché. Each wants or needs the other<br> to change, so the pushy Jewish lefty,<br> Barbara, should be quiet, accommodating,<br> and the accommodating, handsome, laid-back<br> “nice gentile boy” should agree with her<br> that people <i>are</i> their principles.<br> He thinks people can relax a little,<br> be happy. If only<br> they could both become<br><i>nothing</i>, they can stay together.<br><br> All her wishing and wanting and needing<br> won’t make that happen. She marches<br> against the Nazis, the Blacklist, the bomb,<br> through the movie decades, and he doesn’t<br> want to be a great unpopular novelist,<br> so he writes badly for movies,<br> and later, television.<br> At the end<br> (it’s the early ’60s), when they meet again<br> in front of the Plaza, his look—the blank<br> Redford quizzicality I’ve learned<br> is his whole expressive repertoire—<br> seems to ask, “Why? Why did I love you?<br> Why do I still? Why aren’t you<br> like me?”<br> And because the director’s<br> a liberal, Streisand’s the wiser one,<br> more human than Redford—she’s leafletting,<br> to ban the bomb, in the ’70s she’ll be<br> Another Mother for Peace—the way<br> she wriggles her sensual mouth<br> (a mannerism that’s become familiar<br> in the years since this movie was new)<br> I know she loves him or at least yearns<br> for him, still wants him, which is more<br> piercing, more <i>selfish</i>.<br> This morning, my throat<br> is constricted, my head aches, I’m always<br> like this, this movie reminds me you don’t get<br> what you want, even if you’re not weak,<br> or mean, or criminal. I wish I didn’t<br> believe that message so utterly. Today<br> I need to believe something more useful,<br> more positive.<br> Once, when I was a child,<br> my mother lied to me. Maybe that day<br> I was too demanding, more likely I needed<br> consolation—my schoolmates so lucky,<br> so confident, so gentile. Either<br> she meant to reassure me, or—more likely—<br> to instruct when she said (she couldn’t have<br> believed it, the ’40s had happened)<br> that the meek inherit the earth. That was<br> lesson one of our course in resignation.<br> My little mother,<br> little kitten,<br> be patient, I’m trying, it’s for you<br> I’m opening this can of worms,<br> for you I’m opening this can of food.<br><br>\n",

I wondered<br> Why the cities I walked through drifted into cloud<br> Even as I admired their architecture, as I pointed out<br> The cornerstones marked “1820,” “1950.” The only songs<br> I ever loved were filled with scratch, dispatches from<br> A time when dead ones like me were a dime a dozen.<br> I spent my life in hotels: some looked like mansions,<br> Some more like trailer parks, or pathways toward<br> A future I tried to point to, but how could I point,<br> With nothing but a hand no hand ever matched,<br> With fingers that melted into words that no one read.<br>  <br> I rehearsed names that others taught me: Caravaggio,<br> Robert Brandom, Judith, Amber, Emmanuelle Cat.           <br> I got hungry the way only the dead get hungry,<br> The hunger that launches a thousand dirty wars,<br> But I never took part in the wars, because no one lets<br> A dead man into their covert discussions.<br> So I drifted from loft to cellar, ageless like a ghost,<br> And America became my compass, and Europe became<br> The way that dead folks talk, in short, who cares,<br> There’s nothing to say because nobody listens,<br> There’s no radio for the dead and the pillows seem<br> Like sand. Let me explain: when you’re alive,<br> As I understand it, pillows cushion the head, the way<br> A lover might soothe the heart. The way it works for me,<br> In contrast, is everything is sand. Beds are sand,<br> The women I profess to love are sand, the sound of music<br> In the darkest night is sand, and whatever I have to say<br> Is sand. This is not, for example, a political poem,<br> Because the dead have no politics. They might have<br> A hunger, but nothing you’ve ever known<br> Could begin to assuage it.<br><br>\n",

<br>Is all at peace that breast within? <br>Good angels! warn her of the sin! <br>Alas! what boots it? who can save <br>A willing victim of the wave? <br>Who cleanse a soul that loves its guilt? <br>Or gather wine when wine is spilt?<br><br>We quit the holy house and gain <br>The open air; then, happy twain, <br>Adown familiar streets we go,<br>And now and then she turns to show, <br>With fears that all is changing fast, <br>Some spot that’s sacred to her Past.<br>Here by this way, through shadows cool,<br>A little maid, she tripped to school; <br>And there each morning used to stop <br>Before a wonder of a shop<br>Where, built of apples and of pears, <br>Rose pyramids of golden spheres; <br>While, dangling in her dazzled sight, <br>Ripe cherries cast a crimson light, <br>And made her think of elfin lamps, <br>And feast and sport in fairy camps, <br>Whereat, upon her royal throne <br>(Most richly carved in cherry-stone), <br>Titania ruled, in queenly state, <br>The boisterous revels of the fête!<br>’T was yonder, with their “horrid” noise, <br>Dismissed from books, she met the boys, <br>Who, with a barbarous scorn of girls, <br>Glanced slightly at her sunny curls, <br>And laughed and leaped as reckless by <br>As though no pretty face were nigh! <br>But—here the maiden grows demure—<br>Indeed she’s not so <i>very</i> sure, <br>That in a year, or haply twain, <br>Few looked who failed to look again, <br>And sooth to say, I little doubt <br>(Some azure day, the truth will out!) <br>That certain baits in certain eyes <br>Caught many an unsuspecting prize; <br>And somewhere underneath these eaves <br>A budding flirt put forth its leaves!<br><br>Has not the sky a deeper blue, <br>Have not the trees a greener hue,<br>And bend they not with lordlier grace<br>And nobler shapes above the place <br>Where on one cloudless winter morn <br>My Katie to this life was born? <br>Ah, folly! long hath fled the hour <br>When love to sight gave keener power, <br>And lovers looked for special boons <br>In brighter flowers and larger moons. <br>But wave the foliage as it may, <br>And let the sky be ashen gray, <br>Thus much at least a manly youth<br>May hold—and yet not blush—as truth: <br>If near that blessed spot of earth <br>Which saw the cherished maiden’s birth <br>No softer dews than usual rise, <br>And life there keeps its wonted guise, <br>Yet not the less that spot may seem <br>As lovely as a poet’s dream;<br>And should a fervid faith incline <br>To make thereof a sainted shrine, <br>Who may deny that round us throng <br>A hundred earthly creeds as wrong, <br>But meaner far, which yet unblamed <br>Stalk by us and are not ashamed. <br>So, therefore, Katie, as our stroll <br>Ends at this portal, while you roll <br>Those lustrous eyes to catch each ray <br>That may recall some vanished day,<br>I—let them jeer and laugh who will—<br>Stoop down and kiss the sacred sill!<br><br>So strongly sometimes on the sense <br>These fancies hold their influence,<br>That in long well-known streets I stray <br>Like one who fears to lose his way. <br>The stranger, I, the native, she,<br>Myself, not Kate, have crossed the sea; <br>And changing place, and mixing times, <br>I walk in unfamiliar climes!<br>These houses, free to every breeze <br>That blows from warm Floridian seas,<br>Assume a massive English air,<br>And close around an English square; <br>While, if I issue from the town, <br>An English hill looks greenly down, <br>Or round me rolls an English park, <br>And in the Broad I hear the Larke! <br>Thus when, where woodland violets hide, <br>I rove with Katie at my side,<br>It scarce would seem amiss to say, <br>“Katie! my home lies far away, <br>Beyond the pathless waste of brine, <br>In a young land of palm and pine! <br>There, by the tropic heats, the soul <br>Is touched as if with living coal, <br>And glows with such a fire as none <br>Can feel beneath a Northern sun, <br>Unless—my Katie’s heart attest!—<br>’T is kindled in an English breast! <br>Such is the land in which I live, <br>And, Katie! such the soul I give. <br>Come! ere another morning beam, <br>We’ll cleave the sea with wings of steam; <br>And soon, despite of storm or calm, <br>Beneath my native groves of palm,<br>Kind friends shall greet, with joy and pride, <br>The Southron and his English bride!”<br><br>\n",

The beautiful nude<br> obscured by dust in a paperweight<br> was righteousness. Neglectful townships coming<br> into steep flower just as boys were flowering<br> needed the correction of righteousness,   <br> the horizontal slag of government<br> by children. Only the insane allegiances<br> endure. The mad counterparts are lovers<br> passion cannot explain nor circumstances<br> restrict to the dead zones of irony.<br> A counterpart of end of the Cold War<br> is adultery. A counterpart<br> of loving a divided Berlin<br> unto death is fatherhood, the doting<br> maintenance of sons in vacant lots<br> continuing the wars of rubble<br> for righteousness’ sake and for the sake<br> of nudes obscured by dust and vulgarity.<br><br> Romance torments romance. The most beautiful<br> moment of the twentieth century<br> galed and embraced the acrid smoky air<br> as the Red Army entered Berlin<br> as Hitler shriveled in the gasoline fire<br> as Red Army flags opened above Berlin<br> safeguarding the ruins of a changeless future.<br> Townships blackened even as they flowered.<br> Loose balloons cluttered the low sky and sun.<br> I walked for a long time and tried to conjure<br> the form of kindness. It was a domestic<br> animal confused in the tall grass.<br> Boys set fire to the grass. History<br> that opens flags opened the fire,<br> and Berlin, divided from Berlin,<br> began to love its children past all reason.<br><br> 2.<br> My son reads sermons of pain and writes on walls.<br> He starves the ground<br> he walks on, preparing a dead city<br> to be worthy of its new flags, to shine<br> as exploded windows shine, raining down<br> for hours after the wrecking crews have gone.<br> I have a lover now who hates children.<br> The hatred floats inside of her, a weightless<br> sexual pavilion of perfect form<br> and perfect emptiness. I thought<br> by making love to her I would conceive<br> nothing but Terror, outrage upon outrage,<br> a violence that would last my whole life<br> and free my son. I was ignorant as a balloon.<br><br> Across the luminous expressway, I see<br> the shapes of charred tenements castellated,<br> fading into the more tender shapes of night.<br> It may be the last night in history. Tomorrow<br> pulls down the Berlin Wall, pulls down my honor,<br> and I return to my lover’s bed to float<br> in a white condom, no longer my son’s father.<br> Tomorrow describes everything in detail.<br> It explains nothing. It does not teach my boy<br> that tenements are better than the future,<br> better that peace, more likely to produce<br> brothers than are the glassy hands of mornings<br> without end or walls denuded of their wire.<br> In the dead zone of irony before dawn,<br> only the cats cry, like martyrs in the flame.<br><br> 3.<br> Gates everywhere. The Brandenburg. The Great<br> Gate of Kiev beneath which children stride<br> onto an invisible crescendo<br> disappearing into gasoline fires,<br> emerging as the new shapes of righteousness<br> in slow vans through the Brandenburg Gate.<br> Oaths are secret because none suspects<br> that they are kept. They thrust themselves towards us<br> unashamedly, like the insane homeless,<br> and we do not see them. In our loneliness,<br> we see a chance for love in betrayal,<br> not death. In our loneliness, we see the happy<br> triumph of glassy hands in free elections,<br> not the denuding of Berlin or wanderings<br> of children in vans reduced by fire<br> to black transparencies in the morning shade.<br> When Joan of Arc surrendered to the flames<br> she cried out “Jesus, Jesus.” Some years later,<br> a failed magician who had loved her cried out<br> “Joan, Joan” as the flames mocked him with a sortilege<br> too easy to be unreal or profitable.<br><br> I walk for a long time and try to conjure<br> the form of loneliness without Cold War.<br> It is ash upon ash, a chiaroscuro<br> aloft and on the ground, completely still.<br> Oaths are secret because none suspects<br> the desperation of every object, the child<br> in every atom of the misused world<br> thrust towards us, crying out whatever<br> sacred name it witnessed put to death<br> on the ascending music of a wall.<br> Our buildings are tall and have no names.<br> The parks grow glassy hands instead of flowers.<br><br> 4.<br> Afterwards, the calm is piteous<br> but insubstantial as a smell of burn<br> that does not rise in smoke or dies with the fire.<br> Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise<br> and having to invent air, invent light<br> from nothing but untriggered memory.<br> All things beloved are recalled to pain.<br> Air recollected from the wrists of girls<br> braceleted for Confirmation, crossed.<br> Light recollected from between the cars<br> of night trains in a deep river valley<br> where islands in the river glowed like swans.<br> Air recollected form a ditch in flower.<br> Light recollected from the sex of flowers<br> in bare rooms, the grainy light of blondes.<br> Air recollected from religion.<br> Light recollected form the incensed clutch<br> of bodies before sunrise in the oaths<br> of a great and ignorant lost cause.<br><br> Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise<br> having spent the night in bed with a stranger.<br> Aloft and on the ground the calm<br> unfurls like flags without device or slogan.<br> The inconsequence of the day ahead<br> stirs airless atmospheres in darkness<br> visible as daylight but without shade.<br> Without Cold War, without the arbitrary<br> demarcation of cause from cause, of light<br> and air from the unsexed improvisations<br> of memory, I cannot see to walk<br> or breathe to breathe. Sex becomes applause.<br> Sex becomes television, and the bastard<br> avant garde of lonely architecture<br> breaks ground at the unwired heart of a city<br> that marks the capital of nothing now.<br><br> 5.<br> A scratchy, recorded call to prayer crosses<br> the alley from one new building into mine.<br> The consolations of history are furtive,<br> then fugitive, then forgotten like a bar<br> of music that might have been obscene or sacred<br> once, in another city, in the days<br> before today. My son is well. He works<br> the public ground and needs no Antigone.<br> My lover sits beside him at dinner,<br> sharing a joke, unmapping the tall future<br> and its unbiased children, reinventing<br> the sexual pavilion to accommodate<br> plague wards. Romance forgives romance.<br><br> The early isolation of this gorgeous<br> century disappears into good works.<br> The future is best. To put a final stop<br> to the grotesque unmercy of martyrdom<br> and to the ruinous armies of mad boys<br> whose government is rape, whose justice<br> is a wall, revoke all partisanship,<br> adjourn the Terror. The future is best.<br> It unobscures the dusty nudes. It protects<br> the river islands and their glowing swans.<br> But when I need to die, who will light the fire?<br> What names shall I cry out and what music<br> burn to a black transparency in my heart?<br> The unborn have been revoked. They will not be kind.<br><br>\n",

She turned<br><br> into the driveway and leaped in the dark. A blackbird<br> perched on the bouncing twig of a maple, heard<br><br> her whisper, “Stranger, lover, the lost days are over.<br> While I walk from car to door, something inward opens<br><br> like four o’clocks in rain. Earth, cold from autumn,<br> pulls me. I can’t breathe the same<br><br> with dirt for marrow and mist for skin,<br> blurring my vision, my vision’s separate self.<br><br> I stand drunk in this glitter, under the sky’s grey shelter.<br> The city maple, not half so bitter, hurls itself<br><br> in two directions, until both tips darken and disappear,<br> as I darken my reflection in the smoking mirror<br><br> of my home. How faint the sound of dry leaves,<br> like the clattering keys of another morning, another world.”<br><br>                                        <strong>II.</strong><br><br> She looked out the window at some inward greying door.<br> The maple held her glance, made ground fog from her cigarette.<br><br> Beyond uneven stairs, children screamed,<br> gunned each other down. Then she sealed her nimble dreams<br><br> with water from a murky bay. “For him I map<br> this galaxy of dust that turns without an answer.<br><br> When it rains, I remember his face in the corridor<br> of a past apartment and trace the anguish around his mouth,<br><br> his wrinkled forehead, unguarded eyes, the foreign fruit<br> of an intricate sadness. With the grace that remains,<br><br> I catch a glint around a door I cannot enter.<br> The clock echoes in dishtowels; I search love’s center<br><br> and bang pans against the rubble of my day, the lucid<br> grandeur of wet ground, the strangeness of a fatal sun<br><br> that makes us mark on the margin of our loss,<br> trust in the gossamer of touch, trust in the late-plowed field.”<br><br>                                        <strong>III.</strong><br><br> When the sun opened clouds and walked into her mongrel soul,<br> she chopped celery into rocky remnants of the sea,<br><br> and heard fat sing up bread, a better dying.<br> The magnet in each seed of the green pepper kept her flying,<br><br> floating toward memories that throb like clustered stars:<br> the dark water laughter of ducks, a tangle of November oaks,<br><br> toward sudden music on a wheel of brilliant dust<br> where like a moon she must leap back and forth<br><br> from emptiness. “I remember the moon shimmering<br> loss and discovery along a water edge, and skirting<br><br> a slice of carrot, I welcome eternity in that sad eye of autumn.<br> Rare and real, I dance while vegetables sing in pairs.<br><br> I hug my death, my chorus of years, and search<br> and stretch and leap, for I will be apprentice to the blood<br><br> in spite of the mood of a world<br> that keeps rusting, rusting the wild throats of birds.”<br><br>                                        <strong>IV.</strong><br><br> In lamplight she saw the smoke of another’s dream:<br> her daughter walk woods where snow weighs down pine,<br><br> her son cry on a bridge that ends in deep-rooted dark,<br> her man, stalled on a lonely road, realize his torque<br><br> was alcohol and hatred. “Hungry for silence, I listen<br> to wind, to the sound of water running down mountain,<br><br> my own raw breath. Between the sounds, a seaborn god<br> plays his reed in the caverns of my being.<br><br> I wear his amethyst, let go my dreams: Millars, Lacewings,<br> and Junebugs scatter, widen and batter the dark,<br><br> brightening this loud dust with the fever of their eyes.<br> Oh crazy itch that grabs us beyond loss<br><br> and lets us forgive, so that we can answer birds and deer,<br> lightning and rain, shadow and hurricane.<br><br> Truth waits in the creek, cutting the winter brown hills.<br> It sings with needles of ice, sings because of its scar.”<br>\n",

<br>      And thou didst heal us with thy piteous kiss; <br>But see now, Lord; her mouth is lovelier. <br><br>She is right fair; what hath she done to thee? <br>Nay, fair Lord Christ, lift up thine eyes and see; <br>      Had now thy mother such a lip — like this? <br>Thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to me. <br><br>Inside the Horsel here the air is hot; <br>Right little peace one hath for it, God wot; <br>      The scented dusty daylight burns the air, <br>And my heart chokes me till I hear it not. <br><br>Behold, my Venus, my soul's body, lies <br>With my love laid upon her garment-wise, <br>      Feeling my love in all her limbs and hair <br>And shed between her eyelids through her eyes. <br><br>She holds my heart in her sweet open hands <br>Hanging asleep; hard by her head there stands, <br>      Crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh like fire, <br>Love, wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sands — <br><br>Hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume <br>That shift and steam — loose clots of arid fume <br>      From the sea's panting mouth of dry desire; <br>There stands he, like one labouring at a loom. <br><br>The warp holds fast across; and every thread <br>That makes the woof up has dry specks of red; <br>      Always the shuttle cleaves clean through, and he <br>Weaves with the hair of many a ruined head. <br><br>Love is not glad nor sorry, as I deem; <br>Labouring he dreams, and labours in the dream, <br>      Till when the spool is finished, lo I see <br>His web, reeled off, curls and goes out like steam. <br><br>Night falls like fire; the heavy lights run low, <br>And as they drop, my blood and body so <br>      Shake as the flame shakes, full of days and hours <br>That sleep not neither weep they as they go. <br><br>Ah yet would God this flesh of mine might be <br>Where air might wash and long leaves cover me, <br>      Where tides of grass break into foam of flowers, <br>Or where the wind's feet shine along the sea. <br><br>Ah yet would God that stems and roots were bred <br>Out of my weary body and my head, <br>      That sleep were sealed upon me with a seal, <br>And I were as the least of all his dead. <br><br>Would God my blood were dew to feed the grass, <br>Mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as glass, <br>      My body broken as a turning wheel, <br>And my mouth stricken ere it saith Alas! <br><br>Ah God, that love were as a flower or flame, <br>That life were as the naming of a name, <br>      That death were not more pitiful than desire, <br>That these things were not one thing and the same! <br><br>Behold now, surely somewhere there is death: <br>For each man hath some space of years, he saith, <br>      A little space of time ere time expire, <br>A little day, a little way of breath. <br><br>And lo, between the sundawn and the sun, <br>His day's work and his night's work are undone; <br>      And lo, between the nightfall and the light, <br>He is not, and none knoweth of such an one. <br><br>Ah God, that I were as all souls that be, <br>As any herb or leaf of any tree, <br>      As men that toil through hours of labouring night, <br>As bones of men under the deep sharp sea. <br><br>Outside it must be winter among men; <br>For at the gold bars of the gates again <br>      I heard all night and all the hours of it <br>The wind's wet wings and fingers drip with rain. <br><br>Knights gather, riding sharp for cold; I know <br>The ways and woods are strangled with the snow; <br>      And with short song the maidens spin and sit <br>Until Christ's birthnight, lily-like, arow. <br><br>The scent and shadow shed about me make <br>The very soul in all my senses ache; <br>      The hot hard night is fed upon my breath, <br>And sleep beholds me from afar awake. <br><br>Alas, but surely where the hills grow deep, <br>Or where the wild ways of the sea are steep, <br>      Or in strange places somewhere there is death, <br>And on death's face the scattered hair of sleep. <br><br>There lover-like with lips and limbs that meet <br>They lie, they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat; <br>      But me the hot and hungry days devour, <br>And in my mouth no fruit of theirs is sweet. <br><br>No fruit of theirs, but fruit of my desire, <br>For her love's sake whose lips through mine respire; <br>      Her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower, <br>Mine eyelids on mine eyes like fire on fire. <br><br>So lie we, not as sleep that lies by death, <br>With heavy kisses and with happy breath; <br>      Not as man lies by woman, when the bride <br>Laughs low for love's sake and the words he saith. <br><br>For she lies, laughing low with love; she lies <br>And turns his kisses on her lips to sighs, <br>      To sighing sound of lips unsatisfied, <br>And the sweet tears are tender with her eyes. <br><br>Ah, not as they, but as the souls that were <br>Slain in the old time, having found her fair; <br>      Who, sleeping with her lips upon their eyes, <br>Heard sudden serpents hiss across her hair. <br><br>Their blood runs round the roots of time like rain: <br>She casts them forth and gathers them again; <br>      With nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies <br>Exceeding pleasure out of extreme pain. <br><br>Her little chambers drip with flower-like red, <br>Her girdles, and the chaplets of her head, <br>      Her armlets and her anklets; with her feet <br>She tramples all that winepress of the dead. <br><br>Her gateways smoke with fume of flowers and fires, <br>With loves burnt out and unassuaged desires; <br>      Between her lips the steam of them is sweet, <br>The languor in her ears of many lyres. <br><br>Her beds are full of perfume and sad sound, <br>Her doors are made with music, and barred round <br>      With sighing and with laughter and with tears, <br>With tears whereby strong souls of men are bound. <br><br>There is the knight Adonis that was slain; <br>With flesh and blood she chains him for a chain; <br>      The body and the spirit in her ears <br>Cry, for her lips divide him vein by vein. <br><br>Yea, all she slayeth; yea, every man save me; <br>Me, love, thy lover that must cleave to thee <br>      Till the ending of the days and ways of earth, <br>The shaking of the sources of the sea. <br><br>Me, most forsaken of all souls that fell; <br>Me, satiated with things insatiable; <br>      Me, for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth, <br>Yea, laughter kindles at the heart of hell. <br><br>Alas thy beauty! for thy mouth's sweet sake <br>My soul is bitter to me, my limbs quake <br>      As water, as the flesh of men that weep, <br>As their heart's vein whose heart goes nigh to break. <br><br>Ah God, that sleep with flower-sweet finger-tips <br>Would crush the fruit of death upon my lips; <br>      Ah God, that death would tread the grapes of sleep <br>And wring their juice upon me as it drips. <br><br>There is no change of cheer for many days, <br>But change of chimes high up in the air, that sways <br>      Rung by the running fingers of the wind; <br>And singing sorrows heard on hidden ways. <br><br>Day smiteth day in twain, night sundereth night, <br>And on mine eyes the dark sits as the light; <br>      Yea, Lord, thou knowest I know not, having sinned, <br>If heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight. <br><br>Yea, as if earth were sprinkled over me, <br>Such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea, <br>      Each pore doth yearn, and the dried blood thereof <br>Gasps by sick fits, my heart swims heavily, <br><br>There is a feverish famine in my veins; <br>Below her bosom, where a crushed grape stains <br>      The white and blue, there my lips caught and clove <br>An hour since, and what mark of me remains? <br><br>I dare not always touch her, lest the kiss <br>Leave my lips charred. Yea, Lord, a little bliss, <br>      Brief bitter bliss, one hath for a great sin; <br>Nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is. <br><br>Sin, is it sin whereby men's souls are thrust <br>Into the pit? yet had I a good trust <br>      To save my soul before it slipped therein, <br>Trod under by the fire-shod feet of lust. <br><br>For if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath, <br>I look between the iron sides of death <br>      Into sad hell where all sweet love hath end, <br>All but the pain that never finisheth. <br><br>There are the naked faces of great kings, <br>The singing folk with all their lute-playings; <br>      There when one cometh he shall have to friend <br>The grave that covets and the worm that clings. <br><br>There sit the knights that were so great of hand, <br>The ladies that were queens of fair green land, <br>      Grown grey and black now, brought unto the dust, <br>Soiled, without raiment, clad about with sand. <br><br>There is one end for all of them; they sit <br>Naked and sad, they drink the dregs of it, <br>      Trodden as grapes in the wine-press of lust, <br>Trampled and trodden by the fiery feet. <br><br>I see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell <br>Cities and people whom the gods loved well, <br>      Yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold, <br>And for their sakes on her the fire of hell. <br><br>And softer than the Egyptian lote-leaf is, <br>The queen whose face was worth the world to kiss, <br>      Wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold; <br>And large pale lips of strong Semiramis, <br><br>Curled like a tiger's that curl back to feed; <br>Red only where the last kiss made them bleed; <br>      Her hair most thick with many a carven gem, <br>Deep in the mane, great-chested, like a steed. <br><br>Yea, with red sin the faces of them shine; <br>But in all these there was no sin like mine; <br>      No, not in all the strange great sins of them <br>That made the wine-press froth and foam with wine. <br><br>For I was of Christ's choosing, I God's knight, <br>No blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light; <br>      I can well see, for all the dusty days <br>Gone past, the clean great time of goodly fight. <br><br>I smell the breathing battle sharp with blows, <br>With shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows; <br>      The fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways, <br>Sounds and long lights are shed between the rows <br><br>Of beautiful mailed men; the edged light slips, <br>Most like a snake that takes short breath and dips <br>      Sharp from the beautifully bending head, <br>With all its gracious body lithe as lips <br><br>That curl in touching you; right in this wise <br>My sword doth, seeming fire in mine own eyes, <br>      Leaving all colours in them brown and red <br>And flecked with death; then the keen breaths like sighs, <br><br>The caught-up choked dry laughters following them, <br>When all the fighting face is grown a flame <br>      For pleasure, and the pulse that stuns the ears, <br>And the heart's gladness of the goodly game. <br><br>Let me think yet a little; I do know <br>These things were sweet, but sweet such years ago, <br>      Their savour is all turned now into tears; <br>Yea, ten years since, where the blue ripples blow, <br><br>The blue curled eddies of the blowing Rhine, <br>I felt the sharp wind shaking grass and vine <br>      Touch my blood too, and sting me with delight <br>Through all this waste and weary body of mine <br><br>That never feels clear air; right gladly then <br>I rode alone, a great way off my men, <br>      And heard the chiming bridle smite and smite, <br>And gave each rhyme thereof some rhyme again, <br><br>Till my song shifted to that iron one; <br>Seeing there rode up between me and the sun <br>      Some certain of my foe's men, for his three <br>White wolves across their painted coats did run. <br><br>The first red-bearded, with square cheeks — alack, <br>I made my knave's blood turn his beard to black; <br>      The slaying of him was a joy to see: <br>Perchance too, when at night he came not back, <br><br>Some woman fell a-weeping, whom this thief <br>Would beat when he had drunken; yet small grief <br>      Hath any for the ridding of such knaves; <br>Yea, if one wept, I doubt her teen was brief. <br><br>This bitter love is sorrow in all lands, <br>Draining of eyelids, wringing of drenched hands, <br>      Sighing of hearts and filling up of graves; <br>A sign across the head of the world he stands, <br><br>An one that hath a plague-mark on his brows; <br>Dust and spilt blood do track him to his house <br>      Down under earth; sweet smells of lip and cheek, <br>Like a sweet snake's breath made more poisonous <br><br>With chewing of some perfumed deadly grass, <br>Are shed all round his passage if he pass, <br>      And their quenched savour leaves the whole soul weak, <br>Sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was. <br><br>As one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds <br>Smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds, <br>      And tracking ever slotwise the warm smell <br>Is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds, <br><br>His head far down the hot sweet throat of her — <br>So one tracks love, whose breath is deadlier, <br>      And lo, one springe and you are fast in hell, <br>Fast as the gin's grip of a wayfarer. <br><br>I think now, as the heavy hours decease <br>One after one, and bitter thoughts increase <br>      One upon one, of all sweet finished things; <br>The breaking of the battle; the long peace <br><br>Wherein we sat clothed softly, each man's hair <br>Crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair; <br>      The sounds of sharp spears at great tourneyings, <br>And noise of singing in the late sweet air. <br><br>I sang of love too, knowing nought thereof; <br>\"Sweeter,\" I said, \"the little laugh of love <br>      Than tears out of the eyes of Magdalen, <br>Or any fallen feather of the Dove. <br><br>\"The broken little laugh that spoils a kiss, <br>The ache of purple pulses, and the bliss <br>      Of blinded eyelids that expand again — <br>Love draws them open with those lips of his, <br><br>\"Lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown <br>Of one same fire and colour with their own; <br>      Then ere one sleep, appeased with sacrifice, <br>Where his lips wounded, there his lips atone.\" <br><br>I sang these things long since and knew them not; <br>\"Lo, here is love, or there is love, God wot, <br>      This man and that finds favour in his eyes,\" <br>I said, \"but I, what guerdon have I got? <br><br>\"The dust of praise that is blown everywhere <br>In all men's faces with the common air; <br>      The bay-leaf that wants chafing to be sweet <br>Before they wind it in a singer's hair.\" <br><br>So that one dawn I rode forth sorrowing; <br>I had no hope but of some evil thing, <br>      And so rode slowly past the windy wheat <br>And past the vineyard and the water-spring, <br><br>Up to the Horsel. A great elder-tree <br>Held back its heaps of flowers to let me see <br>      The ripe tall grass, and one that walked therein, <br>Naked, with hair shed over to the knee. <br><br>She walked between the blossom and the grass; <br>I knew the beauty of her, what she was, <br>      The beauty of her body and her sin, <br>And in my flesh the sin of hers, alas! <br><br>Alas! for sorrow is all the end of this. <br>O sad kissed mouth, how sorrowful it is! <br>      O breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings, <br>Red with the bitter blossom of a kiss! <br><br>Ah, with blind lips I felt for you, and found <br>About my neck your hands and hair enwound, <br>      The hands that stifle and the hair that stings, <br>I felt them fasten sharply without sound. <br><br>Yea, for my sin I had great store of bliss: <br>Rise up, make answer for me, let thy kiss <br>      Seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin, <br>Lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is. <br><br>Yet I waxed faint with fume of barren bowers, <br>And murmuring of the heavy-headed hours; <br>      And let the dove's beak fret and peck within <br>My lips in vain, and Love shed fruitless flowers. <br><br>So that God looked upon me when your hands <br>Were hot about me; yea, God brake my bands <br>      To save my soul alive, and I came forth <br>Like a man blind and naked in strange lands <br><br>That hears men laugh and weep, and knows not whence <br>Nor wherefore, but is broken in his sense; <br>      Howbeit I met folk riding from the north <br>Towards Rome, to purge them of their souls' offence, <br><br>And rode with them, and spake to none; the day <br>Stunned me like lights upon some wizard way, <br>      And ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight; <br>So rode I, hearing all these chant and pray, <br><br>And marvelled; till before us rose and fell <br>White cursed hills, like outer skirts of hell <br>      Seen where men's eyes look through the day to night, <br>Like a jagged shell's lips, harsh, untunable, <br><br>Blown in between by devils' wrangling breath; <br>Nathless we won well past that hell and death, <br>      Down to the sweet land where all airs are good, <br>Even unto Rome where God's grace tarrieth. <br><br>Then came each man and worshipped at his knees <br>Who in the Lord God's likeness bears the keys <br>      To bind or loose, and called on Christ's shed blood, <br>And so the sweet-souled father gave him ease. <br><br>But when I came I fell down at his feet, <br>Saying, \"Father, though the Lord's blood be right sweet, <br>      The spot it takes not off the panther's skin, <br>Nor shall an Ethiop's stain be bleached with it. <br><br>\"Lo, I have sinned and have spat out at God, <br>Wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod <br>      More sharp because of mine exceeding sin, <br>And all his raiment redder than bright blood <br><br>\"Before mine eyes; yea, for my sake I wot <br>The heat of hell is waxen seven times hot <br>      Through my great sin.\" Then spake he some sweet word, <br>Giving me cheer; which thing availed me not; <br><br>Yea, scarce I wist if such indeed were said; <br>For when I ceased — lo, as one newly dead <br>      Who hears a great cry out of hell, I heard <br>The crying of his voice across my head. <br><br>\"Until this dry shred staff, that hath no whit <br>Of leaf nor bark, bear blossom and smell sweet, <br>      Seek thou not any mercy in God's sight, <br>For so long shalt thou be cast out from it.\" <br><br>Yea, what if dried-up stems wax red and green, <br>Shall that thing be which is not nor has been? <br>      Yea, what if sapless bark wax green and white, <br>Shall any good fruit grow upon my sin? <br><br>Nay, though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree, <br>And though men drew sweet waters of the sea, <br>      There should not grow sweet leaves on this dead stem, <br>This waste wan body and shaken soul of me. <br><br>Yea, though God search it warily enough, <br>There is not one sound thing in all thereof; <br>      Though he search all my veins through, searching them <br>He shall find nothing whole therein but love. <br><br>For I came home right heavy, with small cheer, <br>And lo my love, mine own soul's heart, more dear <br>      Than mine own soul, more beautiful than God, <br>Who hath my being between the hands of her — <br><br>Fair still, but fair for no man saving me, <br>As when she came out of the naked sea <br>      Making the foam as fire whereon she trod, <br>And as the inner flower of fire was she. <br><br>Yea, she laid hold upon me, and her mouth <br>Clove unto mine as soul to body doth, <br>      And, laughing, made her lips luxurious; <br>Her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south, <br><br>Strange spice and flower, strange savour of crushed fruit, <br>And perfume the swart kings tread underfoot <br>      For pleasure when their minds wax amorous, <br>Charred frankincense and grated sandal-root. <br><br>And I forgot fear and all weary things, <br>All ended prayers and perished thanksgivings, <br>      Feeling her face with all her eager hair <br>Cleave to me, clinging as a fire that clings <br><br>To the body and to the raiment, burning them; <br>As after death I know that such-like flame <br>      Shall cleave to me for ever; yea, what care, <br>Albeit I burn then, having felt the same? <br><br>Ah love, there is no better life than this; <br>To have known love, how bitter a thing it is, <br>      And afterward be cast out of God's sight; <br>Yea, these that know not, shall they have such bliss <br><br>High up in barren heaven before his face <br>As we twain in the heavy-hearted place, <br>      Remembering love and all the dead delight, <br>And all that time was sweet with for a space? <br><br>For till the thunder in the trumpet be, <br>Soul may divide from body, but not we <br>      One from another; I hold thee with my hand, <br>I let mine eyes have all their will of thee, <br><br>I seal myself upon thee with my might, <br>Abiding alway out of all men's sight <br>      Until God loosen over sea and land <br>The thunder of the trumpets of the night. <br><br><br>\n",

            "<p>When the strong drag of the boy’s adolescence pulls through them, the<br>family rises into thinness and begins to break like a wave.<br> <br>You turned away when I kissed you, the woman says. Why?<br> <br>Half-lidded days of early winter.<br> <br>When he points toward the woman, the boy looks at his hand the way dogs<br>will.<br> <br>The boy’s jaw sets. As though behind his teeth, into the soft flesh of his<br>throat, a new set of teeth were cutting through. A mouth for what?<br> <br>Each of them adopts a private view. Arguments veer every which way, and<br>who can follow? A sequence of dark non sequiturs blows in.<br> <br>When one, when one word, when the word suicide enters the room where<br>they are shouting, the system closes down, prematurely becalmed.<br> <br>The man writes, I am not given a subject but am given to my subject. I<br>am inside it like a parasite.<br> <br>He sees the woman’s face contract at the approach of other futures than the<br>one for which her face was prepared.<br> <br>So they inhabit their bodies like music, for a given time. And yet he<br>continues to act as if there were times to come.<br> <br>I just want you to go away, one of them screams.<br> <br>Expressionless and flat as a tortilla, the afternoon moon over their house.<br> <br>She calls the man to a corner in the basement. Those aren’t spider eggs, he<br>says, backing up. Those are its eyes.<br> <br>When the encounter with the self is volcanic, nothing can follow.<br> <br>Tearing open the cocoon to reveal itself, a boy within the family.<br> <br>As if they were waiting. As if inside experience, bright with meaning,<br>there were another experience pendant, unnameable.</p>\n",

Me, this puddle<br> of a middle, this utilized vessel,<br> cracked hull, divine<br>  <br> design. It’s how it works. It’s how<br> we all got here.

Then you will kiss my lips and taste the mayon­naise and <br> that is how you shall love me in my restaurant<br><br> Tom, will you come to my empty beige apartment and help me set up my daybed?<br> Yes, and I will put the screws in loosely so that when we move on it, later,<br> it will rock like a cradle and then you will know you are my baby<br><br> Tom, I am sitting on my dirt bike on the deck. Will you come out from the kitchen<br> and watch the people with me?<br> Yes, and then we will race to your bedroom. I will win and we will tangle up<br> on your comforter while the sweat rains from our stomachs and fore­heads<br><br> Tom, the stars are sitting in tonight like gumball gems in a little girl’s <br> jewelry box. Later can we walk to the duck pond?<br> Yes, and we can even go the long way past the jungle gym. I will push you on<br> the swing, but promise me you’ll hold tight. If you fall I might disappear<br><br> Tom, can we make a baby together? I want to be a big pregnant woman with a<br> loved face and give you a squalling red daughter.<br> No, but I will come inside you and you will be my daughter<br><br> Tom, will you stay the night with me and sleep so close that we are one person?<br> No, but I will lie down on your sheets and taste you. There will be feathers<br> of you on my tongue and then I will never forget you<br><br> Tom, when we are in line at the convenience store can I put my hands in your<br> back pockets and my lips and nose in your baseball shirt and feel the crook<br> of your shoulder blade?<br> No, but later you can lie against me and almost touch me and when I go I will<br> leave my shirt for you to sleep in so that always at night you will be pressed<br> up against the thought of me<br><br> Tom, if I weep and want to wait until you need me will you promise that someday<br> you will need me?<br> No, but I will sit in silence while you rage, you can knock the chairs down<br> any mountain. I will always be the same and you will always wait<br><br> Tom, will you climb on top of the dumpster and steal the sun for me? It’s just<br> hanging there and I want it.<br> No, it will burn my fingers. No one can have the sun: it’s on loan from God.<br> But I will draw a picture of it and send it to you from Richmond and then you<br> can smooth out the paper and you will have a piece of me as well as the sun<br><br> Tom, it’s so hot here, and I think I’m being born. Will you come back from<br> Richmond and baptise me with sex and cool water?<br> I will come back from Richmond. I will smooth the damp spiky hairs from the<br> back of your neck and then I will lick the salt off it. Then I will leave<br><br> Tom, Richmond is so far away. How will I know how you love me?<br> I have left you. That is how you will know<br><br>\n",

she sleeps; the starry jasmine<br>     Breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me.<br>Sweeter unpossessed, have I said of her my sweetest?<br>     Not while she sleeps: while she sleeps the jasmine breathes,<br>Luring her to love;

None of what I write arrives<br> to compromise that sacrament,<br><br> the mystery of spirit graved<br> in what is commonplace and plain—<br> the broken, brittle crust, the cup.<br><br> Quite otherwise, I choose instead<br> to bear again the news that each,<br> each was still <em>itself</em>, substantial<br><br> in the simplest sense. By now, you<br> will have learned of Magdalen, a name<br> recalled for having won a touch<br><br> of favor from the one we call<br> the son of man, and what you’ve heard<br> is true enough. I met him first<br><br> as, mute, he scribbled in the dust<br> to shame some village hypocrites<br> toward leaving me unbloodied,<br><br> if ill-disposed to taking up<br> again a prior circumstance.<br> I met him in the house of one<br><br> who was a Pharisee and not<br> prepared to suffer quietly<br> my handling of the master’s feet.<br><br> Much later, in the garden when,<br> having died and risen, he spoke<br> as to a maid and asked me why<br><br> I wept. When, at <em>any</em> meeting<br> with the Christ, was I not weeping?<br> For what? I only speculate<br><br> —brief inability to speak,<br> a weak and giddy troubling near<br> the throat, a wash of gratitude.<br><br> And early on, I think, some slight<br> abiding sense of shame, a sop<br> I have inferred more recently<br><br> to do without. Lush poverty!<br> I think that <em>this</em> is what I’m called<br> to say, this mild exhortation<br><br> that one should still abide <em>all</em> love’s<br> embarrassments, and so resist<br> the new temptation—dangerous,<br><br> inexpedient mask—of shame.<br> And, well, perhaps one other thing:<br> I have received some little bit<br><br> about the glib divisions which<br> so lately have occurred to you<br> as right, as necessary, fit<br><br> That the body is something less<br> than honorable, say, in its<br> ... appetites? That the spirit is<br><br> something pure, and—if all goes well—<br> potentially unencumbered<br> by the body’s bawdy tastes.<br><br> This disposition, then, has led<br> to a banal and pious lack<br> of charity, and, worse, has led<br><br> more than a few to attempt some<br> soul-preserving severance—harsh<br> mortifications, manglings, all<br><br> manner of ritual excision<br> lately undertaken to prevent<br> the body’s claim upon the <em>heart</em>,<br><br> or <em>mind</em>, or (blasphemy!) <em>spirit</em>—<br> whatever name you fix upon<br> the supposéd <em>bodiless</em>.<br><br> I fear that you presume—dissecting<br><em>the person</em> unto something less<br> complex. I think that you forget<br><br> you are not Greek. I think that you<br> forget the very issue which<br> induced the Christ to take on flesh.<br><br> All loves are bodily, require<br> that the lips part, and press their trace<br> of secrecy upon the one<br><br> beloved—the one, or many, endless<br> array whose aspects turn to face<br> the one who calls, the one whose choice<br><br> it was one day to lift my own<br> bruised body from the dust, where, it seems<br> to me, I must have met my death,<br><br> thereafter, this subsequent life<br> and late disinclination toward<br> simple reductions in the name<br><br> of Jesus, whose image I work<br> daily to retain. I have kissed<br> his feet. I have looked long<br><br> into the trouble of his face,<br> and met, in that intersection,<br> the sacred place—where body<br><br> and spirit both abide, both yield,<br> in mutual obsession. Yes,<br> if you’ll recall your Hebrew <em>word</em>.<br><br> just long enough to glimpse in its<br> dense figure <em>power to produce</em><br> you’ll see as well the damage Greek<br><br> has wrought upon your tongue, stolen<br> from your sense of what is holy,<br> wholly good, fully animal—<br><br><em>the body</em> which he now prepares.<br><br>\n",

            "Master of the murmuring courts <br>      Where the shapes of sleep convene!— <br>Lo! my spirit here exhorts <br>      All the powers of thy demesne <br>      For their aid to woo my queen. <br>          What reports <br>      Yield thy jealous courts unseen? <br><br>   Vaporous, unaccountable, <br>      Dreamland lies forlorn of light, <br>Hollow like a breathing shell. <br>      Ah! that from all dreams I might <br>      Choose one dream and guide its flight! <br>          I know well <br>      What her sleep should tell to-night. <br><br>   There the dreams are multitudes: <br>      Some that will not wait for sleep, <br>Deep within the August woods; <br>      Some that hum while rest may steep <br>      Weary labour laid a-heap; <br>          Interludes, <br>      Some, of grievous moods that weep. <br><br>   Poets' fancies all are there: <br>      There the elf-girls flood with wings <br>Valleys full of plaintive air; <br>      There breathe perfumes; there in rings <br>      Whirl the foam-bewildered springs; <br>          Siren there <br>      Winds her dizzy hair and sings. <br><br>   Thence the one dream mutually <br>      Dreamed in bridal unison, <br>Less than waking ecstasy; <br>      Half-formed visions that make moan <br>      In the house of birth alone; <br>          And what we <br>      At death's wicket see, unknown. <br><br>   But for mine own sleep, it lies <br>      In one gracious form's control, <br>Fair with honourable eyes, <br>      Lamps of a translucent soul: <br>      O their glance is loftiest dole, <br>          Sweet and wise, <br>      Wherein Love descries his goal. <br><br>   Reft of her, my dreams are all <br>      Clammy trance that fears the sky: <br>Changing footpaths shift and fall; <br>      From polluted coverts nigh, <br>      Miserable phantoms sigh; <br>          Quakes the pall, <br>      And the funeral goes by. <br><br>   Master, is it soothly said <br>      That, as echoes of man's speech <br>Far in secret clefts are made, <br>      So do all men's bodies reach <br>      Shadows o'er thy sunken beach,— <br>          Shape or shade <br>      In those halls pourtrayed of each? <br><br>   Ah! might I, by thy good grace <br>      Groping in the windy stair, <br>(Darkness and the breath of space <br>      Like loud waters everywhere,) <br>      Meeting mine own image there <br>          Face to face, <br>      Send it from that place to her! <br><br>   Nay, not I; but oh! do thou, <br>      Master, from thy shadowkind <br>Call my body's phantom now: <br>      Bid it bear its face declin'd <br>      Till its flight her slumbers find, <br>          And her brow <br>      Feel its presence bow like wind. <br><br>   Where in groves the gracile Spring <br>      Trembles, with mute orison <br>Confidently strengthening, <br>      Water's voice and wind's as one <br>      Shed an echo in the sun. <br>          Soft as Spring, <br>      Master, bid it sing and moan. <br><br>   Song shall tell how glad and strong <br>      Is the night she soothes alway; <br>Moan shall grieve with that parched tongue <br>      Of the brazen hours of day: <br>      Sounds as of the springtide they, <br>          Moan and song, <br>      While the chill months long for May. <br><br>   Not the prayers which with all leave <br>      The world's fluent woes prefer,— <br>Not the praise the world doth give, <br>      Dulcet fulsome whisperer;— <br>      Let it yield my love to her, <br>          And achieve <br>      Strength that shall not grieve or err. <br><br>   Wheresoe'er my dreams befall, <br>      Both at night-watch, (let it say,) <br>And where round the sundial <br>      The reluctant hours of day, <br>      Heartless, hopeless of their way, <br>          Rest and call;— <br>      There her glance doth fall and stay. <br><br>   Suddenly her face is there: <br>      So do mounting vapours wreathe <br>Subtle-scented transports where <br>      The black firwood sets its teeth. <br>      Part the boughs and look beneath,— <br>          Lilies share <br>      Secret waters there, and breathe. <br><br>   Master, bid my shadow bend <br>      Whispering thus till birth of light, <br>Lest new shapes that sleep may send <br>      Scatter all its work to flight;— <br>      Master, master of the night, <br>          Bid it spend <br>      Speech, song, prayer, and end aright. <br><br>   Yet, ah me! if at her head <br>      There another phantom lean <br>Murmuring o'er the fragrant bed,— <br>      Ah! and if my spirit's queen <br>      Smile those alien prayers between,— <br>          Ah! poor shade! <br>      Shall it strive, or fade unseen? <br><br>   How should love's own messenger <br>      Strive with love and be love's foe? <br>Master, nay! If thus, in her, <br>      Sleep a wedded heart should show,— <br>      Silent let mine image go, <br>          Its old share <br>      Of thy spell-bound air to know. <br><br>   Like a vapour wan and mute, <br>      Like a flame, so let it pass; <br>One low sigh across her lute, <br>      One dull breath against her glass; <br>      And to my sad soul, alas! <br>          One salute <br>      Cold as when Death's foot shall pass. <br><br>   Then, too, let all hopes of mine, <br>      All vain hopes by night and day, <br>Slowly at thy summoning sign <br>      Rise up pallid and obey. <br>      Dreams, if this is thus, were they:— <br>          Be they thine, <br>      And to dreamworld pine away. <br><br>   Yet from old time, life, not death, <br>      Master, in thy rule is rife: <br>Lo! through thee, with mingling breath, <br>      Adam woke beside his wife. <br>      O Love bring me so, for strife, <br>          Force and faith, <br>      Bring me so not death but life! <br><br>   Yea, to Love himself is pour'd <br>      This frail song of hope and fear. <br>Thou art Love, of one accord <br>      With kind Sleep to bring her near, <br>      Still-eyed, deep-eyed, ah how dear. <br>          Master, Lord, <br>      In her name implor'd, O hear!<br><br>\n",

No, and it wasn’t only that Rome<br>           Was <em>my</em> city of the night, that it was here I’d chosen   <br>                      To live when I grew tired of my ancient life<br> As the Underground Man. And it wasn’t that Rome’s darkness   <br>                      Was of the kind that consoles so many<br>           Vacancies of the soul; my Rome, with its endless history   <br> Of falls ... No, it was that this dark was the deep, sensual dark<br>                      Of the dreamer; this dark was like the violet fur   <br> Spread to reveal the illuminated nipples of<br>                      The She-Wolf—all the sequins above in sequence,   <br> The white buds lost in those fields of ever-deepening gentians,<br>           A dark like the polished back of a mirror,<br>                      The pool of the night scalloped and hanging   <br> Above me, the inverted reflection of a last,<br>                                                                 Odd Narcissus ...<br><br>                                            One night my friend Nico came by   <br> Close to three <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">a.m.</span>—As we drank a little wine, I could see<br>                      The black of her pupils blown wide,   <br> The spread ripples of the opiate night ... And Nico<br>           Pulled herself close to me, her mouth almost<br>                      Touching my mouth, as she sighed, “Look ... ,”<br> And deep within the pupil of her left eye,<br>           Almost like the mirage of a ship’s distant, hanging<br>                      Lantern rocking with the waves,<br> I could see, at the most remote end of the receding,<br>           Circular hallway of her eye, there, at its doorway,   <br> At the small aperture of the black telescope of the pupil,<br>                                A tiny, dangling crucifix—   <br> Silver, lit by the ragged shards of starlight, reflecting<br>           In her as quietly as pain, as simply as pain ...<br> Some years later, I saw Nico on stage in New York, singing<br>           Inside loosed sheets of shattered light, a fluid   <br> Kaleidoscope washing over her—the way any naked,<br>                      Emerging Venus steps up along the scalloped lip<br>           Of her shell, innocent and raw as fate, slowly   <br> Obscured by a florescence that reveals her simple, deadly<br>                                Love of sexual sincerity ...<br>           I didn’t bother to say hello. I decided to remember   <br> The way in Rome, out driving at night, she’d laugh as she let<br>           Her head fall back against the cracked, red leather<br>                                Of my old Lancia’s seats, the soft black wind   <br> Fanning her pale, chalky hair out along its currents,<br>           Ivory waves of starlight breaking above us in the leaves;   <br> The sad, lucent malevolence of the heavens, falling ...<br>                      Both of us racing silently as light. Nowhere,   <br> Then forever ...<br>                                            Into the mind of the Roman night.<br><br>\n",

Or the other notion that,<br> because there is in this world no one thing<br> to which the bramble of <em>blackberry</em> corresponds,<br> a word is elegy to what it signifies.<br> We talked about it late last night and in the voice<br> of my friend, there was a thin wire of grief, a tone<br> almost querulous. After a while I understood that,<br> talking this way, everything dissolves: <em>justice,<br> pine, hair, woman, you</em> and <em>I</em>. There was a woman<br> I made love to and I remembered how, holding<br> her small shoulders in my hands sometimes,<br> I felt a violent wonder at her presence<br> like a thirst for salt, for my childhood river<br> with its island willows, silly music from the pleasure boat,<br> muddy places where we caught the little orange-silver fish<br> called <em>pumpkinseed</em>. It hardly had to do with her.<br> Longing, we say, because desire is full<br> of endless distances. I must have been the same to her.<br> But I remember so much, the way her hands dismantled bread,<br> the thing her father said that hurt her, what<br> she dreamed. There are moments when the body is as numinous<br> as words, days that are the good flesh continuing.<br> Such tenderness, those afternoons and evenings,<br> saying <em>blackberry, blackberry, blackberry</em>.<br><br>\n",

            "<p>          Am I to become profligate as if I were a blonde? Or religious as if I were French?<br><br>          Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous (and how the same names keep recurring on that interminable list!), but one of these days there’ll be nothing left with which to venture forth.<br><br>          Why should I share you? Why don’t you get rid of someone else for a change?<br><br>          I am the least difficult of men. All I want is boundless love.<br><br>          Even trees understand me! Good heavens, I lie under them, too, don’t I? I’m just like a pile of leaves.<br><br>          However, I have never clogged myself with the praises of pastoral life, nor with nostalgia for an innocent past of perverted acts in pastures. No. One need never leave the confines of New York to get all the greenery one wishes—I can’t even enjoy a blade of grass unless I know there’s a subway handy, or a record store or some other sign that people do not totally <em>regret</em> life. It is more important to affirm the least sincere; the clouds get enough attention as it is and even they continue to pass. Do they know what they’re missing? Uh huh.<br><br>          My eyes are vague blue, like the sky, and change all the time; they are indiscriminate but fleeting, entirely specific and disloyal, so that no one trusts me. I am always looking away. Or again at something after it has given me up. It makes me restless and that makes me unhappy, but I cannot keep them still. If only I had grey, green, black, brown, yellow eyes; I would stay at home and do something. It’s not that I am curious. On the contrary, I am bored but it’s my duty to be attentive, I am needed by things as the sky must be above the earth. And lately, so great has <em>their</em> anxiety become, I can spare myself little sleep.<br><br>          Now there is only one man I love to kiss when he is unshaven. Heterosexuality! you are inexorably approaching. (How discourage her?)<br><br>          St. Serapion, I wrap myself in the robes of your whiteness which is like midnight in Dostoevsky. How am I to become a legend, my dear? I’ve tried love, but that hides you in the bosom of another and I am always springing forth from it like the lotus—the ecstasy of always bursting forth! (but one must not be distracted by it!) or like a hyacinth, “to keep the filth of life away,” yes, there, even in the heart, where the filth is pumped in and courses and slanders and pollutes and determines. I will my will, though I may become famous for a mysterious vacancy in that department, that greenhouse.<br><br>          Destroy yourself, if you don’t know!<br><br>          It is easy to be beautiful; it is difficult to appear so. I admire you, beloved, for the trap you’ve set. It's like a final chapter no one reads because the plot is over.<br><br>          “Fanny Brown is run away—scampered off with a Cornet of Horse; I do love that little Minx, &amp; hope She may be happy, tho’ She has vexed me by this Exploit a little too. —Poor silly Cecchina! or F:B: as we used to call her. —I wish She had a good Whipping and 10,000 pounds.” —Mrs. Thrale.<br><br>       I’ve got to get out of here. I choose a piece of shawl and my dirtiest suntans. I’ll be back, I'll re-emerge, defeated, from the valley; you don’t want me to go where you go, so I go where you don’t want me to. It’s only afternoon, there’s a lot ahead. There won’t be any mail downstairs. Turning, I spit in the lock and the knob turns.</p>\n",

            "<p>Wife two was a stripper. And sweet, as well. He traded her in for me. To people I don't know, I say she was a dancer. I watch them, puzzled, wonder how anyone could not love a ballerina. And you have to question a guy like that: trading in a sweet stripper for me. Not a homemaker. Not home much at all. Not sweet. More like my grandfather, Jimmy Grieco. Mean. My mother likes to describe the blue-sky day when she bought me a helium balloon and I let it go. I was six. I begged for another. She said, <em>okay, but, if you let this one go, I’m really going to be mad</em>. I nodded, took the string in my hand, held tight, and then opened my hand flat so the balloon lifted and its string slipped up and away. <em>You were never sweet</em>, my mother says.</p><p align=\"center\"> </p><p align=\"center\">***</p><p>In Vegas, a few weeks ago, Jimmy and I sorted photographs in his double-wide just off Boulder Highway. My mother stood on the sidelines. She hates how I ask Jimmy for the hard stories. Tell me about the moonshine. Tell me about the dead kids. Tell me how your mother saved the family by burning down the farm. Jimmy’s crooked finger points to a picture of the family. That was Leonard. <em>He was deaf and dumb</em>. Died at twelve. That was Vincent. <em>The baby who fell off the staircase without a rail</em>. Dead at two. Then there's his mother, surrounded by her children. <em>She was tough</em>, he says. <em>Tough</em>. When Chicago’s Black Hand demanded ten thousand dollars, she stuffed five grand in her apron, grabbed my grandfather—then five—and took him to deliver the money. <em>That's all you'll ever get</em>, she said, <em>and don’t touch my kids or I’ll kill you.</em></p><p> </p><p align=\"center\">***</p><p>My grandfather never asks about the first or second wife. I don’t have to tell him that ballerina-fable. He knows I’m three and mean. He knows it for his whole life. His first, my grandmother, was like sugar. He burned her, abandoned her in LA, raced to Mexico, paved road turning to dirt; he ate prickly pear, maybe, on the way to his quick divorce. And, though he won’t tell this story, his own father lived, first, with a sweet woman on a wheat farm, far south in Craco, Italy. He boarded a ship, told his wife he’d send for her, and then fled to New York. And in an apartment on Mulberry Street, he met up with the new girlfriend and they disappeared into their new world. She wasn’t pretty. <em>She was tough</em>. She got busted twice for making moonshine. Her sons loved her. She was mean.</p>\n",

So we began.<br> His armies retook Nubia, Libya, and the Levant,<br> lost under the sway-bellied lantern-jawed Sun King.<br> Overseer of all scribes, Overseer of the priests of Horus,<br> Grain-giver to all lands, Royal chief of staff, Regent,<br> the general had himself carried on his palanquin<br> through the wailing processions<br> to oversee the work on this place. And so carved, thus:<br> one of his men punches a Nubian in the face.<br> The general was low-born; everything had counted<br> and he knew what counted most.<br> His platoons lift open palms towards Tutankhamun.<br> The general towers as a sway-girdled go-between at court<br> for beseeching Libyans.<br> Only the pearl-handled revolvers do not figure here,<br> or the comeback challenge <i>Nuts!</i> in the Ardennes winter forest.<br> He had himself carried beyond the busy streets of the dead<br> in the city of the dead sloping back from the bluff<br> to a higher, private terrace looking across to Memphis.<br> But then he rose to Pharaoh. So he is not here. Instead<br> his first wife lay here, and then his queen also.<br> At his own royal tomb in the Valley, where the designs<br> remained uncarved, sketching idea along stone,<br> he does not rest either. The fine picklock hand<br> got past Anubis and the reared serpents, and got to him,<br> the Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt. It got past Truth<br> with her high feather, which moved at the slightest disturbance.<br> The general did deep obeisance to her. He is not here.<br><br> What at last moves the heart?<br><br> So much already moved, even in his own century,<br> architects prying loose mud bricks of the core for new tombs.<br> Cult funded in perpetuity gone in two generations.<br> So Coleridge, who was indisposed that day, prudently<br> remained in the circle of lime trees while his friends went off<br> on their walk through the countryside. He followed them in his mind.<br> That way no one would have to dismantle Horeheb’s outer court<br> to secure bricks for the statuary room, and facing stones.<br> He cast his mind outward, a net over his dear ones,<br> sending them at pace through the middle distance of steeples,<br> hill lines, and the murder of Lamb’s mother by his sister,<br> a brief madness, thus through the appropriately middle distance<br> where such things are built and performed in fact, no closer, no farther,<br> then on out to the cleansing rim of apocalypse, evening<br> in the bath of waning fire, one bird stitching<br> the whole veil of showings tight along its upper hem—<br> though he was not there, he could tell them that none the less<br> he was next to his words and his word was with them, even<br> unto the rim of their wandering and their turning back.<br> One dome of air and fire. But he was not there. Nor I here.<br><br> What removes the heart from what moves it?<br><br> As if I were the lecturer before a congress of doctors,<br> his clinching point approaching, when suddenly he stared out<br> in silence, and at last said, <i>Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues,<br> the only thing I can see at this moment inside my brain,<br> such as it is, is a little white mouse chasing a little white ball.</i><br> Their laughter recovered him. But he’d found he was not there.<br> And Nietzsche smooched the dray horse. Soon, too, he was not there.<br> Or rather in five places, seeking cartage, and thinking he’d found it.<br><br> What removal does not pass through the rippling pump room?<br><br> The G.I. whose father had been raised in a Swiss house along<br> one of the lakes knocked, in uniform, and asked to see it,<br> and conned the dark-paneled ceilings, and drank Schnapps, and took<br> photos of the owners. And then he knew he was not there.<br><br> Where is the room if it always surrounds you?<br><br> An interviewer came to Thomas Mann after the war, from Italy.<br> The interviewer was a poet. Mann offered him no coffee, and<br> called him <i>Signor Mountainous.</i> Not there, the poet.<br><br> The <i>Riss</i> between body and soul, the ancient killing fields<br> of Prudentius, Pauline salt poured in the cut, that rift<br> deeper than the Mariana Trench: these are the gift of all<br> dualisms, a yawn between detaching spacecraft shooting<br> over the blue-white swirl betweeen continents. <i>Nicht da</i>,<br> that separation widening to meters, we see the not-there.<br><br> What moves but the heart?<br><br> If you wait for the sun to take it at the slant angle,<br> and if you gaze at his crouched from long enough, then<br> it will move. At ease on the general’s head and fish-like hands<br> floats the <i>djed</i> column, its foliate<br> abundance, leafed powers, stemming out to the bud.<br><br> He rises beneath it and there is no strain on his face,<br> valves of space intervene between the stone and his palms,<br> its basal flare like a parasol shelters him, who under<br> any other circumstances, in that spot, would be red gristle.<br> Twelve tons, but chiseled at the requisite depth he goes in<br> beneath it and rises. Light with him. And he’s not there.<br><br> Nor are you there, finisher still here and breathing me, though<br> steadily you intimate such. But paradox is your <i>forte.</i><br> You whose touch lifted this very weight for awhile<br> pass, fluttering interpreter<br> of the last things in our tawdry updrafts of the fake,<br> the last first butterfly. My brothers maintain<br> that the hot wind is friend, lifter of stones, trembler of heavy<br> horizons, for they half-remember that for them you vanished<br> into ripples at the join of sky and dust, until<br> the column floats only because ther are no longer<br> aware that they stagger beneath it. And I with them though<br> I am not here, having been grazed by your wing, its razory mercy.<br><br>\n",

            "<p>september is a month like any other and unlike any other. it seems in september everything awaited will arrive: in the calm air, in a particular scent, in the stillness of the quay. when september comes, i know i’m going to lose myself. the ants climbing my legs and a certain change of light tell me so. the air comes and goes beneath my dress, pressing the warm cloth against me, pressing me with the desire to find myself in the sea, that sea beaten deep gray and magnetized by neutrinos, thanks to which i can perform my observations and telekinetic communications. the salty, sticky wall of the Malecón is covered with fish and forgotten hooks. i like to lick its sheen of salt and make my tongue salty and sticky. in that moment the rest of the city can vanish, it’s just that sea and me, before all thought, all desire. then i undress and enter, knowing i’ll find something, and that the boats—which seem suspended on the horizon, seem to have slipped their limits, motionless and painted there—are also mine...when i met you and you met me it was still september and we were strange and different and would be for a long time after—though i sometimes snagged you with certain secret hooks, shaping a sort of formless impression: something strange and indefinable divided the outline of your body from the space around you, but without making a human form, and in your eyes the sunlight revolved like a bicycle’s spoked wheel...the bicycle moves on and i’m carried along, filled with dry branches and coral. in my hair i wear the butterflies we collected together. the little house, one point amid the infinite, comes into view: already we can see the windows, like little black voids, and their curtains beating in the wind. i squeeze your waist, the bicycle moves on; even though the street is narrow the bicycle rolls on, rolls on against the spray. when you turn your head and see my hand, my hook snagged in a struggle of desire, the sun has turned immense in your eyes again. you make for the little house already in view, already at the edge of the curve...a naked man in lamplight is a magnificent animal: his pointy shoulders jut out and cut off the light. a line of fuzz descends from his navel to where the darkness begins, where the skin tightens like the skin of a fig. his body—your body—is an arc i want to tighten, to overcome, to conquer. hidden behind a tree, i can see your eyes again. the Mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. the arc tightens and closes. i throw an arm over you, a leg, a hand, a lip, hallucinations, an ear—as usual. my body moves on. the Mississippi is a big river with many tributaries. its water burns in my thighs, in the course of my dreams: the Mississippi is a deep and torrential river situated in the United States, it is born in Lake Itasca, passes through St. Paul, St. Louis, Memphis, New Orleans, traverses 3,780 kilometers and slides and slides through a wide delta to the Gulf of Mexico. i’m in geography class. i like this class. the world just barely fits in my head. the map hangs before me with its spokes and points. someone made that all up, just to make me think i belong to one of those zones out there. all those castles and fortifications to toy with, the beginnings of everything that seems to be reality, but isn’t, because we’re not outside but inside the globe, that huge globe so stubborn in its sufficiency, and even far from the classroom nothing’s different: there’s just the idea of that transparent globe that is my image of the world, always turning, imperfect and constant inside me. i like the maps and the instability of the geography that situates places in my head. i like using graph paper to plot the latitudes and longitudes i can’t measure. i also like the geography professor, whose eyes i must constantly avoid in order not to drown myself. he doesn’t know, he can’t imagine, that while he lectures, while he looks at me, i draw fish in my notebook to throw in his river. the boy behind me won’t stop looking at me, and whatever one does the others all follow, watching from the corners of their eyes. that’s why i’m going to fold the page away from his gaze and make a true map where he won’t find me, alone at my desk in the middle of the world...in the middle of the lake there’s a boat and we’re three—although the third may have already vanished for us—and i want to paddle and sit in the center. you’ve taken off your shirt: the landscape appears and disappears. when i take the oars you want to teach me how to row over the edge. you try to teach me: you take my hands—you’re behind and above me. my fingers are lost in the middle of the boat. i’m wearing faded jeans and carrying a purple parasol. the oar descends toward the deep and tangles with seaweed. my hair hangs surly and limp on my wet shoulders. we try to steer but go nowhere. you explain the roundness of the earth; the sharpened tip of the compass needle, always precise, marking contours, lines, limits. the shadow and truth of your body in the landscape: appearances and disappearances when you try to comprehend the possible across great distances, the symmetry, forgetfulness, incarnation in other beings: animals, plants, and later, men once again. you taught me all this, but i’m not a map and i hold still. i abandon my shoes and my dread of nearing the end: the oar descends toward the deep, it is september. we don’t move. i keep still to be different, that’s why...<em><br></em></p>\n",

Soon she’d take bus<br> and ferry from London to Belfast, but first<br> the fire in her bed-sit. Her fingers traveled too,<br>  <br> down the raised purple scars along his vertebrae,<br> the flannel sheets between her thighs, his hair<br> trailing along her abdomen, the quill<br> of a feather poking through seams of the comforter,<br>  <br> the comforter itself.

Everything<br> reduced to trinket and anecdote, the beer<br> and facepaint of carnival, street-dance and tuba,<br> beyond the muddy English roundabouts, the brown<br>  <br> and white waves, yellow lamps along Dutch highways,<br> his work at the union office pinned beneath<br> a glass globe paperweight—shaken<br> it showered silver snow over the wide<br>  <br> straw hat, red and green plow, the slouching body,<br> a campesino from days before Somoza fell.<br> He wondered if she were any better, smuggling<br> French social theory into Ulster, encounter<br>  <br> groups in the rec-centers of tower-block basements.<br> She’d just gotten the news: her last lover died<br> in a fire along the side of the highway, body<br> broken in seven places, silver chrome,<br>  <br> pearl and gold gas tank scorched, his bike crumpled<br> beneath the husk of an overturned van.<br> There wasn’t much to talk about.

Even here.<br><br> That is, if <em>tree</em> were a tree.<br> That is, if <em>star</em> or <em>moon</em> or even <em>beautiful woman</em><br><em>craning the shell of her ear</em><br> were what they were.<br><br> They are, I think, not.<br><br> No: and a poem about nature contains anything but.<br><br><br><strong>5.</strong><br><br> When they descended to us, they were a <em>cloud of stars</em><br> sweeping <em>lightly.</em> They sang to us urgently<br> about our lives,<br><br> they touched us<br> with a <em>hundred thousand hair-soft, small legs—</em><br><br> and held down by such <em>hungers,</em> we let them cover us,<br> this <em>beautiful woman,</em> this <em>me,</em><br><br> who couldn’t move,<br> who were <em>stung</em>—do you hear?—<br> who were stung again, were covered that quickly, crying<br> to each other<br>                      to <em>fly away!</em><br><br><br><strong>6.</strong><br>           ... I just can’t erase<br> the exquisite, weeping language<br> of the wasps, nor her face in starlight<br> and so tranquil under that false, papery, bobbing<br>           moon<br> just minutes before,<br> saying listen,<br><br><em>listen,</em><br><br> nor then the weight<br> of her whole natural body<br>                                        pinning down mine<br> until we both cried out for fear, and pain,<br> and <em>still</em> couldn’t move.<br><br><br><strong>7.</strong><br><br> Language must suffice.<br> First, it doesn’t. Then, of course,<br><br> it does. <em>Listen, listen.</em><br><br> What do you hear? This nearly killed me.<br> I’ll never know<br> why she didn’t just whisper <em>Here they come,</em> warn <em>Move!</em><br> cry <em>They’ll kill us! </em><br> Yes: <em>I will save you ... </em><br> Yes: <em>I love you too much to watch you suffer!</em><br> But it’s all I recall, or now need.<br><br> And, anyway, I loved her, she was so beautiful.<br> And that is what I have had to say<br> before it’s too late,<br>                                before they have killed me,<br> before they have killed you, too,<br><br> or before we have all become something else entirely,<br><br> which is to say<br> before we are<br> only language.<br>\n",

I start on Redford's coffee while he looks glumly<br> at the metal napkin dispenser. Just then, the electric chime<br> above the door sounds. A man sweeps in &amp; rests<br> his guitar case on one of the slim       café chairs.<br> His dark hair is arranged in a series of perpetually<br> break wavefronts. A small muscle jumps in his jaw<br> as he orders a Cinnamon Frenchroll, toasted, with cream cheese.<br> I lean foward, jabbing Redford with my plastic coffee wand.<br><em>Check out that guy over there </em>I say. <em>Intense.</em><br> Redford shrugs. <em>I think he's Irish</em> I say, watching the man bite<br> into his bagel. The instrument case hovers on the chair edge.<br> He could have a guitar in there, or else—a sword from the Crusades.<br> I press my tongue into the square-shaped hole in the lid<br> of my coffee cup. <em>Listen</em> Redford says. <em>If we're going to be together<br> you have to take this.</em> He pushes a small velvet box across the table.<br><em>What are you doing?</em> I ask, but Redford doesn't answer.<br> He just looks down at the table, one hand pressed<br> to each of his temples. In the box is a square of chocolate<br> like the top of a signet ring, smooth, but edged<br> in something bright. <em>It's smoked salt from Wales</em>, Redford says.<br><em>Handmade in limited quantities</em>. I turn the little box<br> in my hands. The salt sparkles like an arctic church.<br> I have to blink against it all.<br><br>\n",

The prose dipped and shimmered<br> and the “flies,” as I heard a buff call them, stood<br><br> at lurid attention on their pins. If you love to read<br> and look, you could be happy a month in that small<br> room. One of the Nabokov photos I’d never seen:<br><br> he’s writing (left-handed! why did I never trouble<br> to find out?) at his stand-up desk in the hotel<br> apartment in Montreux. The picture’s mostly<br><br> of his back and the small wedge of face that shows<br> brims with indifference to anything not on the page.<br> The window’s shut. A tiny lamp trails a veil of light<br><br> over the page, too far away for us to read.<br> We also liked the chest of specimen drawers<br> labeled, as if for apprentice Freudians,<br><br> “Genitalia,” wherein languished in phials<br> the thousands he examined for his monograph<br> on the Lycaenidae, the silver-studded Blues.<br><br> And there in the center of the room a carillon<br> of Blues rang mutely out. There must have been<br> three hundred of them. Amanda’s Blue was there,<br><br> and the Chalk Hill Blue, the Karner Blue<br> (<em>Lycaeides melissa samuelis</em> Nabokov),         <br> a Violet-Tinged Copper, the Mourning Cloak,<br><br> an Echo Azure, the White-Lined Green Hairstreak,<br> the Cretan Argus (known only from Mt. Ida:<br> in the series Nabokov did on this beauty<br><br> he noted for each specimen the altitude at which<br> it had been taken), and as the ads and lovers say,<br> “and much, much more.” The stilled belle of the tower<br><br> was a <em>Lycaeides melissa melissa</em>. No doubt<br> it’s an accident Melissa rhymes, sort of, with Lolita,         <br> The scant hour we could lavish on the Blues<br><br> flew by, and we improvised a path through cars<br> and slush and boot-high berms of mud-blurred snow<br> to wherever we went next. I must have been mute,<br><br> or whatever I said won from silence nothing<br> it mourned to lose. I was back in that small<br> room, vast by love of each flickering detail,<br><br> each genital dusting to nothing, the turn,<br> like a worm’s or caterpillar’s, of each phrase.<br> I stood up to my ankles in sludge pooled<br><br> over a stopped sewer grate and thought—<br> wouldn’t you know it—about love and art:<br> you can be ruined (“rurnt,” as we said in south-<br><br> western Ohio) by a book or improved by<br> a butterfly. You can dodder in the slop,<br> septic with a rage not for order but for the love<br><br> the senses bear for what they do, for detail<br> that’s never annexed, like a reluctant crumb<br> to a vacuum cleaner, to a coherence.<br><br> You can be bead after bead on perception’s rosary.<br> This is the sweet ache that hurts most, the way<br> desire burns bluely at its phosphorescent core:<br><br> just as you’re having what you wanted most,<br> you want it more and more until that’s more<br> than you, or it, or both of you, can bear.<br>  <br><br>\n",

He said he didn't want his body to last.<br> It wasn't a year I could argue<br> against that kind of talk, so I cut the fowl<br> killed on the farm a mile out—brown and silvery, wild—<br> and put it over butter lettuce, lettuce then lime.<br> I heated brandy in the saucepan, poured a strip of molasses<br> slowly through the cold, slow as I'd seen<br> a shaman pour pine tincture over the floor<br> of my beaten house.<br> She seemed to see my whole life<br> by ordinance of some god<br> who wanted me alive again.<br> Burnt sage, blue smoke. Then sea salt shaken<br> into the corners of violent sadness.<br> She wrote my address<br> across her chest<br> to let everything listening know<br> where my life was made.<br> We waited, either forgetting what we were<br> or becoming more brightly human in that pine,<br> in her trance, in the lavender I set on the chipped sills,<br> not a trance at all but my deliberate hand cutting<br> from the yard part of what she required.<br> Now wait longer, she said, and I did as I would<br> when the molasses warmed over the pot enough<br> to come into the brandy,<br> to come into the night<br> begun by small confessions—<br> that this was just a rental, and mine just a floor,<br> that the woman he loved was with another man,<br> his mother mad, his apartment haunted in the crawl space.<br> Then I told of the assault at daybreak between<br> the houses. Heat, asphalt, all of it and my face toward<br> the brick school where the apostolate studied first-century script<br> and song. There must have been chanting,<br> as it was on the hour.<br> What we said was liturgy meant only for us<br> and for that night. Not for anyone else<br> to repeat, live by, believe. Never that.<br> Our only theories were inside of our hands,<br> flesh and land, body and prairie.<br> I reached to smoke down his next-to-last,<br> which he lit and made ready.<br> The poultry like a war ration<br> we ate all the way through.<br> What we wished, we said.<br> What we said, we found that night<br> by these, and no other,<br> means.<br>  <br><br>\n",

What is Love? and where is it? <br>And for that poor Ambition! it springs <br>    From a man’s little heart’s short fever-fit; <br>        For Poesy!—no,—she has not a joy,— <br>    At least for me,—so sweet as drowsy noons, <br>And evenings steep’d in honey’d indolence; <br>        O, for an age so shelter’d from annoy, <br>    That I may never know how change the moons, <br>Or hear the voice of busy common-sense!<br><br> And once more came they by:—alas! wherefore? <br>     My sleep had been embroider’d with dim dreams; <br> My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o’er <br>     With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams: <br>        The morn was clouded, but no shower fell, <br>     Tho’ in her lids hung the sweet tears of May; <br>The open casement press’d a new-leaved vine, <br>     Let in the budding warmth and throstle’s lay; <br>        O Shadows! ’twas a time to bid farewell! <br>Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine.<br><br>So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise <br>    My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass; <br>For I would not be dieted with praise, <br>    A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce! <br>        Fade softly from my eyes, and be once more <br>    In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn; <br>Farewell! I yet have visions for the night, <br>    And for the day faint visions there is store; <br>Vanish, ye Phantoms! from my idle spright, <br>    Into the clouds, and never more return!<br><br>\n",

My lover’s gone back<br>  to his gin and the farm-team fiancée he keeps in New York.<br>   <br>  What else to do but read Frank O’Hara to my tired three-year-old?<br>  When I put him to bed, he mutters “more sorry” as he turns into sleep.<br>   <br>  Tonight, I find you in a box I once marked “The Past.” Well,<br>  therapy’s good for some things, Sandy, but who’d want to forgive<br>   <br>  a girl like that? Frank says <em>Destroy yourself if you don’t know!</em><br>  Deflated, you’re simply the smile that surrounds a hole.<br>                                                                                       I don’t know anything.<br><br>\n",

I have not disappeared.<br> My wife quivers inside a kiss.<br> My pulse was given to her many times,<br><br> in many countries.

Theirs <br>is the revenge school of poetry, with titles like <br>\"My Yellow Sheet Lad\" and \"Given Your Mother's Taste <br>for Vodka, I'm Pretty Sure You're Not Mine.\" <br>They're not trying to make the poems better <br>so much as sharper or louder, more like a fishhook <br>or electrocution, as a group <br>they overcome their individual senilities, <br>their complete distaste for language, how cloying <br>it is, how like tears it can be, and remember <br>every mention of their long hours at the office <br>or how tired they were when they came home, <br>when they were dragged through the door <br>by their shadows. I don't know why it's so hard <br>to write a simple and kind poem to my father, who worked, <br>not like a dog, dogs sleep most of the day in a ball <br>of wanting to chase something, but like a man, a man <br>with seven kids and a house to feed, whose absence <br>was his presence, his present, the Cheerios, <br>the PF Flyers, who taught me things about trees, <br>that they're the most intricate version of standing up, <br>who built a grandfather clock with me so I would know <br>that time is a constructed thing, a passing, ticking fancy.<br>A bomb. A bomb that'll go off soon for him, for me,<br>and I notice in our fathers' poems a reciprocal dwelling <br>on absence, that they wonder why we disappeared<br>as soon as we got our licenses, why we wanted <br>the rocket cars, as if running away from them <br>to kiss girls who looked like mirrors of our mothers<br>wasn't fast enough, and it turns out they did <br>start to say something, to form the words hey <br>or stay, but we'd turned into a door full of sun,<br>into the burning leave, and were gone <br>before it came to them that it was all right <br>to shout, that they should have knocked us down <br>with a hand on our shoulders, that they too are mystified <br>by the distance men need in their love.<br><br>\n",

With motions strange <br>His listless limbs their wayward postures change; <br>While many a crooked line and curious maze <br>With clouted shoon he on the sand portrays. <br>At length the half-chewed straw fell from his mouth, <br>And to himself low spoke the moody youth. <br><br>   ‘How simple is the lad and reft of skill, <br>Who thinks with love to fix a woman’s will: <br>Who every Sunday morn, to please her sight, <br>Knots up his neckcloth gay and hosen white; <br>Who for her pleasure keeps his pockets bare, <br>And half his wages spends on pedlar’s ware; <br>When every niggard clown or dotard old, <br>Who hides in secret nooks his oft-told gold, <br>Whose field or orchard tempts, with all her pride, <br>At little cost may win her for his bride! <br>While all the meed her silly lover gains, <br>Is but the neighbours’ jeering for his pains. <br>On Sunday last, when Susan’s banns were read, <br>And I astonished sat with hanging head, <br>Cold grew my shrinking frame, and loose my knee, <br>While every neighbour’s eye was fixed on me. <br>Ah Sue! when last we worked at Hodge’s hay, <br>And still at me you mocked in wanton play — <br>When last at fair, well pleased by chapman’s stand, <br>You took the new-bought fairing from my hand — <br>When at old Hobb’s you sung that song so gay, <br>‘Sweet William,’ still the burthen of the lay, — <br>I little thought, alas! the lots were cast, <br>That thou shouldst be another’s bride at last; <br>And had, when last we tripped it on the green, <br>And laughed at stiff-backed Rob, small thought I ween, <br>Ere yet another scanty month was flown <br>To see thee wedded to the hateful clown. <br>Ay, lucky churl! more gold thy pockets line, <br>But did these shapely limbs resemble thine, <br>I’d stay at home and tend the household gear, <br>Nor on the green with other lads appear. <br>Ay, lucky churl! no store thy cottage lacks, <br>And round thy barn thick stand the sheltered stacks. <br>But did such features coarse my visage grace, <br>I’d never budge the bonnet from my face. <br>Yet let it be; it shall not break my ease, <br>He best deserves who doth the maiden please. <br>Such silly cause no more shall give me pain, <br>Nor ever maiden cross my rest again. <br>Such grizzled suitors with their taste agree, <br>And the black fiend may take them all for me!’ <br><br>Now through the village rose confused sounds, <br>Hoarse lads, and children shrill, and yelping hounds. <br>Straight every housewife at her door is seen, <br>And pausing hedgers on their mattocks lean. <br>At every narrow lane and alley’s mouth <br>Loud-laughing lasses stand, and joking youth. <br>A bridal band tricked out in colours gay, <br>With minstrels blithe before to cheer the way, <br>From clouds of curling dust that onward fly, <br>In rural splendour break upon the eye. <br>As in their way they hold so gaily on, <br>Caps, beads, and buttons, glancing in the sun, <br>Each village wag with eye of roguish cast, <br>Some maiden jogs and vents the ready jest; <br>While village toasts the passing belles deride, <br>And sober matrons marvel at their pride. <br>But William, head erect, with settled brow, <br>In sullen silence viewed the passing show; <br>And oft he scratched his pate with careless grace, <br>And scorned to pull the bonnet o’er his face; <br>But did with steady look unaltered wait, <br>Till hindmost man had passed the churchyard gate, <br>Then turned him to his cot with visage flat, <br>Where honest Lightfoot on the threshold sat. <br>Up leaped the kindly beast his hand to lick, <br>And for his pains received an angry kick. <br>Loud shuts the door with harsh and thundering din; <br>The echoes round their circling course begin, <br>From cot to cot, church tower, and rocky dell, <br>It grows amain with wide progressive swell, <br>And Lightfoot joins the coil with long and piteous yell.<br><br>\n",

            "As he spoke we could hear, ever more loudly, the noise   <br>Of the burning fires; the flood of flames was coming   <br>Nearer and nearer. “My father, let me take you   <br>Upon my shoulders and carry you with me.   <br>The burden will be easy. Whatever happens,   <br>You and I will experience it together,   <br>Peril or safety, whichever it will be.   <br>Little Iülus will come along beside me.   <br>My wife will follow behind us. And you, my servants,   <br>Listen to what I say: just as you leave   <br>The limits of the city there is a mound,   <br>And the vestiges of a deserted temple of Ceres,   <br>And a cypress tree that has been preserved alive   <br>For many years by the piety of our fathers.   <br>We will all meet there, though perhaps by different ways   <br>And, Father, you must carry in your arms   <br>The holy images of our household gods;   <br>I, coming so late from the fighting and the carnage   <br>Cannot presume to touch them until I have washed   <br>Myself in running water.” Thus I spoke.   <br><br>I take up the tawny pelt of a lion and   <br>Cover my neck and my broad shoulders with it,   <br>And bowing down, I accept the weight of my father;   <br>Iülus puts his hand in mine and goes   <br>Along beside me, trying to match my steps   <br>As best he can, trying his best to keep up.   <br>My wife follows behind us, a little way back.   <br>So we all set out together, making our way   <br>Among the shadows, and I, who only just   <br>A little while ago had faced, undaunted,   <br>Showers of arrows and swarms of enemy Greeks,   <br>Am frightened by every slightest change in the air   <br>And startled by every slightest sound I hear,   <br>Fearful for whom I walk with and whom I carry. <br>And just as I had almost come to the gates   <br>And thought that I had almost gotten us free,   <br>I thought I heard the sound of many feet,   <br>And my father, peering intently into the shadows,   <br>Cries out to me, “Get away, get away, my son,   <br>My son, they are coming! I see their shining shields,   <br>I see the glow of their weapons in the dark!”   <br>I am alarmed, and I don’t know what happened   <br>But some power hostile to me distracts my wits   <br>And I am confused, and I lead us away by ways   <br>That I don’t know, and off the familiar streets   <br>That together we are following, and so,   <br>O God! some fate has taken away my wife,   <br>Creüsa, my wife, away from me. What happened?   <br>Did she wander from the way that we were going?   <br>Did she fall back, having to rest some place   <br>Back there, and so we left her? I did not know.   <br>I never saw her again, and as we went,   <br>I never turned to look behind, and never   <br>Thought of her until we reached the mound   <br>And Ceres’ ancient place. When all of us,   <br>At last, had gotten there, we all were there,   <br>But she had vanished and she wasn’t there.   <br>Gone from her people, gone from her child, and her husband.   <br><br>What men or gods in my frenzy did I not   <br>Cry out against? What worse sight had I seen?   <br>I left Ascanius and Anchises and   <br>The household gods in the care of my companions   <br>And I found a secluded place deep in a valley   <br>For them to hide, and I myself took up   <br>My shining weapons and sought the city again,   <br>Determined, no matter what, to look for my   <br>Creüsa everywhere in Troy. I find   <br>My way along the walls and to, and through,   <br>The shadowed gate I’d left the city by;   <br>Carefully, step by unseen step, in the dark,   <br>Backwards the way I came I make my way;   <br>Everywhere as I go fills me with terror;   <br>The very silence around me fills me with terror.   <br>I make my way to my home in case, in case,   <br>She’s gone back there. The Greeks had invaded the house   <br>And set it on fire, and through the house the fire   <br>Rolled up on the surge of the wind to the very roof,   <br>And the flames tower high above the burning house   <br>And the heat of the burning pours up into the sky.   <br>And so I go on, and once again I see   <br>The palace of Priam, and the citadel,   <br>And in the empty courtyard of Juno’s shrine   <br>There’s Phoenix and dire Ulysses, guarding the treasures   <br>Taken from everywhere from the shrines that the Greeks   <br>Had set fire to; the golden bowls, the holy   <br>Altar-tables, the stolen holy vestments;   <br>Boys and trembling matrons stand around . . .   <br>I wander in the streets, in my desperation   <br>Calling out her name, Creüsa, Creüsa,   <br>Calling Creüsa, over and over again.   <br>And as I went among the ruined buildings   <br>And through the streets of the ruined city, lo,   <br>Suddenly there rose before my eyes   <br>The strangely magnified image of my wife.   <br>I was stupefied; my hair stood on end; my voice   <br>Got caught in my throat. Then she spoke to me and said   <br>Words that altered everything for me:   <br>“Beloved husband, what use is it for you   <br>To persist in this insanity of grief.   <br>What has happened here has happened not without   <br>The will of the gods. The high lord of Olympus   <br>Does not permit Creüsa to go with you   <br>To be with you on your journey where you are going. <br>Long exile will be yours, ploughing across   <br>Vast seas until you come to Hesperia,   <br>Where Lydian Tiber gently flows between   <br>Rich husbanded fields and where you will be happy,   <br>A king, and wedded to a royal wife.   <br>Give up your weeping now for your Creüsa;   <br>I, a Dardan woman and the spouse   <br>Of divine Venus’s son, will never see   <br>The scornful households of the Myrmidons   <br>Or the Dolopians, and never have to be   <br>A scullion slave in service to some Greek matron.   <br>The Mighty Mother keeps me on these shores.   <br>Farewell and may your care protect and cherish   <br>Your child and mine.” And having spoken thus,   <br>The image of her receded into air,   <br>Leaving me weeping, with so much still to say.   <br>Three times I tried to embrace her and to hold her;   <br>Three times the image, clasped in vain, escaped   <br>As if it were a breeze or on the wings   <br>Of a vanishing dream.   <br>                               And so, the night being over,   <br>I returned to my companions where they were.   <br>When I got there I was amazed to see   <br>How many others, women and men, had come,   <br>Wretched survivors of the fall of the city,   <br>To join us in the exile and the journey,   <br>A heartbreaking company, come from everywhere,   <br>Ready in their hearts and with their fortunes,   <br>To follow me wherever I was going.   <br>And now the morning star was rising over   <br>The highest ridges of Ida, bringing in   <br>The day that was beginning; the Danaans held   <br>The city behind the gates that they had locked.   <br>There was no hope of further help. And so   <br>I acknowledged this, and taking up the burden   <br>Of my father once again, I sought the hills.<br><br>\n",

Never, never <br>Brave me, nor my fury tempt: <br>Downy wings, but wroth they beat <br>Tempest even in reason's seat.</em> <br><br><br>   Behind the house the upland falls <br>With many an odorous tree— <br>White marbles gleaming through green halls— <br>Terrace by terrace, down and down, <br>And meets the star-lit Mediterranean Sea. <br><br>   ‘Tis Paradise. In such an hour <br>Some pangs that rend might take release. <br>Nor less perturbed who keeps this bower <br>Of balm, nor finds balsamic peace? <br>From whom the passionate words in vent <br>After long revery's discontent? <br><br>   “Tired of the homeless deep, <br>Look how their flight yon hurrying billows urge, <br>   Hitherward but to reap <br>Passive repulse from the iron-bound verge! <br>Insensate, can they never know <br>’Tis mad to wreck the impulsion so? <br><br>   “An art of memory is, they tell: <br>But to forget! forget the glade <br>Wherein Fate sprung Love's ambuscade, <br>To flout pale years of cloistral life <br>And flush me in this sensuous strife. <br>’Tis Vesta struck with Sappho's smart. <br>No fable her delirious leap: <br>With more of cause in desperate heart, <br>Myself could take it—but to sleep! <br><br>   “Now first I feel, what all may ween, <br>That soon or late, if faded e'en, <br>One's sex asserts itself. Desire, <br>The dear desire through love to sway, <br>Is like the Geysers that aspire— <br>Through cold obstruction win their fervid way. <br>But baffled here—to take disdain, <br>To feel rule's instinct, yet not reign; <br>To dote, to come to this drear shame— <br>Hence the winged blaze that sweeps my soul <br>Like prairie-fires that spurn control, <br>Where withering weeds incense the flame. <br><br>   “And kept I long heaven's watch for this, <br>Contemning love, for this, even this? <br>O terrace chill in Northern air, <br>O reaching ranging tube I placed <br>Against yon skies, and fable chased <br>Till, fool, I hailed for sister there <br>Starred Cassiopea in Golden Chair. <br>In dream I throned me, nor I saw <br>In cell the idiot crowned with straw. <br><br>   “And yet, ah yet, scarce ill I reigned, <br>Through self-illusion self-sustained, <br>When now—enlightened, undeceived— <br>What gain I, barrenly bereaved! <br>Than this can be yet lower decline— <br>Envy and spleen, can these be mine? <br><br>   “The peasant-girl demure that trod <br>Beside our wheels that climbed the way, <br>And bore along a blossoming rod <br>That looked the sceptre of May-Day— <br>On her—to fire this petty hell, <br>His softened glance how moistly fell! <br>The cheat! on briers her buds were strung; <br>And wiles peeped forth from mien how meek. <br>The innocent bare-foot! young, so young! <br>To girls, strong man's a novice weak. <br>To tell such beads! And more remain, <br>Sad rosary of belittling pain. <br><br>   “When after lunch and sallies gay <br>Like the Decameron folk we lay <br>In sylvan groups; and I—let be! <br>O, dreams he, can he dream that one <br>Because not roseate feels no sun? <br>The plain lone bramble thrills with Spring <br>As much as vines that grapes shall bring. <br><br>   “Me now fair studies charm no more. <br>Shall great thoughts writ, or high themes sung <br>Damask wan cheeks—unlock his arm <br>About some radiant ninny flung? <br>How glad with all my starry lore, <br>I'd buy the veriest wanton's rose <br>Would but my bee therein repose. <br><br>   “Could I remake me! or set free <br>This sexless bound in sex, then plunge <br>Deeper than Sappho, in a lunge <br>Piercing Pan's paramount mystery! <br>For, Nature, in no shallow surge <br>Against thee either sex may urge, <br>Why hast thou made us but in halves— <br>Co-relatives? This makes us slaves. <br>If these co-relatives never meet <br>Self-hood itself seems incomplete. <br>And such the dicing of blind fate <br>Few matching halves here meet and mate. <br>What Cosmic jest or Anarch blunder <br>The human integral clove asunder <br>And shied the fractions through life's gate? <br><br>   “Ye stars that long your votary knew <br>Rapt in her vigil, see me here! <br>Whither is gone the spell ye threw <br>When rose before me Cassiopea? <br>Usurped on by love's stronger reign— <br>But, lo, your very selves do wane: <br>Light breaks—truth breaks! Silvered no more, <br>But chilled by dawn that brings the gale <br>Shivers yon bramble above the vale, <br>And disillusion opens all the shore.” <br><br>   One knows not if Urania yet <br>The pleasure-party may forget; <br>Or whether she lived down the strain <br>Of turbulent heart and rebel brain; <br>For Amor so resents a slight, <br>And hers had been such haught disdain, <br>He long may wreak his boyish spite, <br>And boy-like, little reck the pain. <br><br>   One knows not, no. But late in Rome <br>(For queens discrowned a congruous home) <br>Entering Albani's porch she stood <br>Fixed by an antique pagan stone <br>Colossal carved. No anchorite seer, <br>Not Thomas a Kempis, monk austere, <br>Religious more are in their tone; <br>Yet far, how far from Christian heart <br>That form august of heathen Art. <br>Swayed by its influence, long she stood, <br>Till surged emotion seething down, <br>She rallied and this mood she won: <br><br>   “Languid in frame for me, <br>To-day by Mary's convent-shrine, <br>Touched by her picture's moving plea <br>In that poor nerveless hour of mine, <br>I mused—A wanderer still must grieve. <br>Half I resolved to kneel and believe, <br>Believe and submit, the veil take on. <br>But thee, arm’d Virgin! less benign, <br>Thee now I invoke, thou mightier one. <br>Helmeted woman—if such term <br>Befit thee, far from strife <br>Of that which makes the sexual feud <br>And clogs the aspirant life— <br>O self-reliant, strong and free, <br>Thou in whom power and peace unite, <br>Transcender! raise me up to thee, <br>Raise me and arm me!” <br><br>                         Fond appeal. <br>For never passion peace shall bring, <br>Nor Art inanimate for long <br>Inspire. Nothing may help or heal <br>While Amor incensed remembers wrong. <br>Vindictive, not himself he’ll spare; <br>For scope to give his vengeance play <br>Himself he'll blaspheme and betray. <br><br>   Then for Urania, virgins everywhere, <br>O pray! Example take too, and have care. <br><br>\n",

It had a bad solenoid.<br> I held a 12-gauge shotgun across my lap.<br> I expected trouble from the Paragons gang<br> of the west Lynwood <em>barrio.</em><br> Somebody said I dove the car<br> that dudes from <em>Colonia Watts </em>used<br> to shoot up the Paragons’ neighborhood.<br> But I got more than trouble that night.<br> My wife had left around 10 p.m.<br> to take a friend of mine home.<br> She didn’t come back.<br> I wanted to kill somebody.<br> At moments, it had nothing to do<br> with the Paragons.<br> It had to do with a woman I loved.<br> But who to kill?

I was hurt, angry. . .<br> but to kill her? To kill a Paragon?<br> To kill anybody?<br> I went into the house<br> and put the gun away.<br>  <br> Later that morning, my wife came for her things:<br> some clothes, the babies. . . their toys.<br> A radio, broken TV, and some dishes remained.<br> I didn’t stop her.<br> There was nothing to say that my face<br> didn’t explain already.<br> Nothing to do. . . but run.<br>  <br> So I drove the long haul to Downey<br> and parked near an enclosed area<br> alongside the Los Angeles River.<br> I got out of the car,<br> climbed over the fence<br> and stumbled down the slopes.<br> A small line of water rippled in the middle.<br> On rainy days this place flooded and flowed,<br> but most of the time it was dry<br> with dumped garbage and dismembered furniture.<br> Since a child, the river and its veins of canals<br> were places for me to think. Places to heal.<br> Once on the river’s bed, I began to cleanse.<br> I ran.<br>  <br> I ran into the mist of morning,<br> carrying the heat of emotion<br> through the sun’s rays;<br> I ran past the factories<br> that lay smack in the middle<br> of somebody’s backyard.<br> I ran past alleys with overturned trashcans<br> and mounds of tires.<br> Debris lay underfoot. Overgrown weeds<br> scraped my legs as I streamed past;<br> recalling the song of bullets<br> that whirred in the wind.<br>  <br> I ran across bridges, beneath overhead passes,<br> and then back alongside the infested walls<br> of the concrete river;<br> splashing rainwater as I threaded,<br> my heels colliding against the pavement.<br> So much energy propelled my legs<br> and, just like the river,<br> it went on for miles.<br>  <br> When all was gone,<br> the concrete river<br> was always there<br> and me, always running.<br><br>\n",

which, by like way<br>Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;<br>Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,<br>Do both express the face's first impression.<br><br>Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,<br>It you behoves to love, and forth to lay<br>That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,<br>That men the more admire their fountain may;<br>For else what booteth that celestial ray,<br>If it in darkness be enshrined ever,<br>That it of loving eyes be viewed never?<br><br>But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,<br>That likest to yourselves ye them select,<br>The which your forms' first source may sympathize,<br>And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;<br>For, if you loosely love without respect,<br>It is no love, but a discordant war,<br>Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.<br><br>For love is a celestial harmony<br>Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,<br>Which join together in sweet sympathy,<br>To work each other's joy and true content,<br>Which they have harbour'd since their first descent<br>Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see<br>And know each other here belov'd to be.<br><br>Then wrong it were that any other twain<br>Should in love's gentle band combined be<br>But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,<br>And made out of one mould the more t' agree;<br>For all that like the beauty which they see,<br>Straight do not love; for love is not so light<br>As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.<br><br>But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,<br>With pure regard and spotless true intent,<br>Drawing out of the object of their eyes<br>A more refined form, which they present<br>Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;<br>Which it reducing to her first perfection,<br>Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.<br><br>And then conforming it unto the light,<br>Which in itself it hath remaining still,<br>Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,<br>Thereof he fashions in his higher skill<br>An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;<br>And it embracing in his mind entire,<br>The mirror of his own thought doth admire.<br><br>Which seeing now so inly fair to be,<br>As outward it appeareth to the eye,<br>And with his spirit's proportion to agree,<br>He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,<br>And fully setteth his felicity;<br>Counting it fairer than it is indeed,<br>And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.<br><br>For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be<br>Than other men's, and in dear love's delight<br>See more than any other eyes can see,<br>Through mutual receipt of beam{\"e}s bright,<br>Which carry privy message to the spright,<br>And to their eyes that inmost fair display,<br>As plain as light discovers dawning day.<br><br>Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,<br>Armies of loves still flying to and fro,<br>Which dart at them their little fiery lances;<br>Whom having wounded, back again they go,<br>Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;<br>Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,<br>Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.<br><br>In which how many wonders do they rede<br>To their conceit, that others never see,<br>Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,<br>Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;<br>Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;<br>But when her words' embássade forth she sends,<br>Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.<br><br>Sometimes upon her forehead they behold<br>A thousand graces masking in delight;<br>Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold<br>Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight<br>Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;<br>But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,<br>So many millions of chaste pleasures play.<br><br>All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more<br>Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,<br>To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,<br>That may it more to mortal eyes commend,<br>And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:<br>That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,<br>And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.<br><br>Then Iö, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,<br>Advance the banner of thy conquest high,<br>That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,<br>May draw to thee, and with due fealty<br>Adore the power of thy great majesty,<br>Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,<br>Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.<br><br>In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,<br>That she whose conquering beauty doth captive<br>My trembling heart in her eternal chain,<br>One drop of grace at length will to me give,<br>That I her bounden thrall by her may live,<br>And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,<br>May owe to her, of whom I it received.<br><br>And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,<br>Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,<br>When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,<br>Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,<br>That may recure my heart's long pining grief,<br>And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,<br>That can restore a damned wight from death.<br><br><br>\n",

            "But do not let us quarrel any more, <br>No, my Lucrezia; bear with me for once: <br>Sit down and all shall happen as you wish. <br>You turn your face, but does it bring your heart? <br>I'll work then for your friend's friend, never fear, <br>Treat his own subject after his own way, <br>Fix his own time, accept too his own price, <br>And shut the money into this small hand <br>When next it takes mine. Will it? tenderly? <br>Oh, I'll content him,—but to-morrow, Love! <br>I often am much wearier than you think, <br>This evening more than usual, and it seems <br>As if—forgive now—should you let me sit <br>Here by the window with your hand in mine <br>And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole, <br>Both of one mind, as married people use, <br>Quietly, quietly the evening through, <br>I might get up to-morrow to my work <br>Cheerful and fresh as ever. Let us try. <br>To-morrow, how you shall be glad for this! <br>Your soft hand is a woman of itself, <br>And mine the man's bared breast she curls inside. <br>Don't count the time lost, neither; you must serve <br>For each of the five pictures we require: <br>It saves a model. So! keep looking so— <br>My serpentining beauty, rounds on rounds! <br>—How could you ever prick those perfect ears, <br>Even to put the pearl there! oh, so sweet— <br>My face, my moon, my everybody's moon, <br>Which everybody looks on and calls his, <br>And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn, <br>While she looks—no one's: very dear, no less. <br>You smile? why, there's my picture ready made, <br>There's what we painters call our harmony! <br>A common greyness silvers everything,— <br>All in a twilight, you and I alike <br>—You, at the point of your first pride in me <br>(That's gone you know),—but I, at every point; <br>My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down <br>To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole. <br>There's the bell clinking from the chapel-top; <br>That length of convent-wall across the way <br>Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside; <br>The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease, <br>And autumn grows, autumn in everything. <br>Eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape <br>As if I saw alike my work and self <br>And all that I was born to be and do, <br>A twilight-piece. Love, we are in God's hand. <br>How strange now, looks the life he makes us lead; <br>So free we seem, so fettered fast we are! <br>I feel he laid the fetter: let it lie! <br>This chamber for example—turn your head— <br>All that's behind us! You don't understand <br>Nor care to understand about my art, <br>But you can hear at least when people speak: <br>And that cartoon, the second from the door <br>—It is the thing, Love! so such things should be— <br>Behold Madonna!—I am bold to say. <br>   I can do with my pencil what I know, <br>What I see, what at bottom of my heart <br>I wish for, if I ever wish so deep— <br>Do easily, too—when I say, perfectly, <br>I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge, <br>Who listened to the Legate's talk last week, <br>And just as much they used to say in France. <br>At any rate 'tis easy, all of it! <br>No sketches first, no studies, that's long past: <br>I do what many dream of, all their lives, <br>—Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do, <br>And fail in doing. I could count twenty such <br>On twice your fingers, and not leave this town, <br>Who strive—you don't know how the others strive <br>To paint a little thing like that you smeared <br>Carelessly passing with your robes afloat,— <br>Yet do much less, so much less, Someone says, <br>(I know his name, no matter)—so much less! <br>Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged. <br>There burns a truer light of God in them, <br>In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain, <br>Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on to prompt <br>This low-pulsed forthright craftsman's hand of mine. <br>Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know, <br>Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me, <br>Enter and take their place there sure enough, <br>Though they come back and cannot tell the world. <br>My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here. <br>The sudden blood of these men! at a word— <br>Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too. <br>I, painting from myself and to myself, <br>Know what I do, am unmoved by men's blame <br>Or their praise either. Somebody remarks <br>Morello's outline there is wrongly traced, <br>His hue mistaken; what of that? or else, <br>Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that? <br>Speak as they please, what does the mountain care? <br>Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, <br>Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-grey, <br>Placid and perfect with my art: the worse! <br>I know both what I want and what might gain, <br>And yet how profitless to know, to sigh <br>\"Had I been two, another and myself, <br>\"Our head would have o'erlooked the world!\" No doubt. <br>Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth <br>The Urbinate who died five years ago. <br>('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.) <br>Well, I can fancy how he did it all, <br>Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see, <br>Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him, <br>Above and through his art—for it gives way; <br>That arm is wrongly put—and there again— <br>A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines, <br>Its body, so to speak: its soul is right, <br>He means right—that, a child may understand. <br>Still, what an arm! and I could alter it: <br>But all the play, the insight and the stretch— <br>(Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out? <br>Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, <br>We might have risen to Rafael, I and you! <br>Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think— <br>More than I merit, yes, by many times. <br>But had you—oh, with the same perfect brow, <br>And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth, <br>And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird <br>The fowler's pipe, and follows to the snare — <br>Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind! <br>Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged <br>\"God and the glory! never care for gain. <br>\"The present by the future, what is that? <br>\"Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo! <br>\"Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!\" <br>I might have done it for you. So it seems: <br>Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules. <br>Beside, incentives come from the soul's self; <br>The rest avail not. Why do I need you? <br>What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo? <br>In this world, who can do a thing, will not; <br>And who would do it, cannot, I perceive: <br>Yet the will's somewhat—somewhat, too, the power— <br>And thus we half-men struggle. At the end, <br>God, I conclude, compensates, punishes. <br>'Tis safer for me, if the award be strict, <br>That I am something underrated here, <br>Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth. <br>I dared not, do you know, leave home all day, <br>For fear of chancing on the Paris lords. <br>The best is when they pass and look aside; <br>But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all. <br>Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time, <br>And that long festal year at Fontainebleau! <br>I surely then could sometimes leave the ground, <br>Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear, <br>In that humane great monarch's golden look,— <br>One finger in his beard or twisted curl <br>Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile, <br>One arm about my shoulder, round my neck, <br>The jingle of his gold chain in my ear, <br>I painting proudly with his breath on me, <br>All his court round him, seeing with his eyes, <br>Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls <br>Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts,— <br>And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond, <br>This in the background, waiting on my work, <br>To crown the issue with a last reward! <br>A good time, was it not, my kingly days? <br>And had you not grown restless... but I know— <br>'Tis done and past: 'twas right, my instinct said: <br>Too live the life grew, golden and not grey, <br>And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt <br>Out of the grange whose four walls make his world. <br>How could it end in any other way? <br>You called me, and I came home to your heart. <br>The triumph was—to reach and stay there; since <br>I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost? <br>Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold, <br>You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine! <br>\"Rafael did this, Andrea painted that; <br>\"The Roman's is the better when you pray, <br>\"But still the other's Virgin was his wife—\" <br>Men will excuse me. I am glad to judge <br>Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows <br>My better fortune, I resolve to think. <br>For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives, <br>Said one day Agnolo, his very self, <br>To Rafael . . . I have known it all these years . . . <br>(When the young man was flaming out his thoughts <br>Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see, <br>Too lifted up in heart because of it) <br>\"Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub <br>\"Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how, <br>\"Who, were he set to plan and execute <br>\"As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings, <br>\"Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!\" <br>To Rafael's!—And indeed the arm is wrong. <br>I hardly dare . . . yet, only you to see, <br>Give the chalk here—quick, thus, the line should go! <br>Ay, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out! <br>Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth, <br>(What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo? <br>Do you forget already words like those?) <br>If really there was such a chance, so lost,— <br>Is, whether you're—not grateful—but more pleased. <br>Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed! <br>This hour has been an hour! Another smile? <br>If you would sit thus by me every night <br>I should work better, do you comprehend? <br>I mean that I should earn more, give you more. <br>See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star; <br>Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall, <br>The cue-owls speak the name we call them by. <br>Come from the window, love,—come in, at last, <br>Inside the melancholy little house <br>We built to be so gay with. God is just. <br>King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights <br>When I look up from painting, eyes tired out, <br>The walls become illumined, brick from brick <br>Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold, <br>That gold of his I did cement them with! <br>Let us but love each other. Must you go? <br>That Cousin here again? he waits outside? <br>Must see you—you, and not with me? Those loans? <br>More gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that? <br>Well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend? <br>While hand and eye and something of a heart <br>Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth? <br>I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit <br>The grey remainder of the evening out, <br>Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly <br>How I could paint, were I but back in France, <br>One picture, just one more—the Virgin's face, <br>Not yours this time! I want you at my side <br>To hear them—that is, Michel Agnolo— <br>Judge all I do and tell you of its worth. <br>Will you? To-morrow, satisfy your friend. <br>I take the subjects for his corridor, <br>Finish the portrait out of hand—there, there, <br>And throw him in another thing or two <br>If he demurs; the whole should prove enough <br>To pay for this same Cousin's freak. Beside, <br>What's better and what's all I care about, <br>Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff! <br>Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he, <br>The Cousin! what does he to please you more? <br><br>I am grown peaceful as old age to-night. <br>I regret little, I would change still less. <br>Since there my past life lies, why alter it? <br>The very wrong to Francis!—it is true <br>I took his coin, was tempted and complied, <br>And built this house and sinned, and all is said. <br>My father and my mother died of want. <br>Well, had I riches of my own? you see <br>How one gets rich! Let each one bear his lot. <br>They were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died: <br>And I have laboured somewhat in my time <br>And not been paid profusely.

What would one have? <br>In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance— <br>Four great walls in the New Jerusalem, <br>Meted on each side by the angel's reed, <br>For Leonard, Rafael, Agnolo and me <br>To cover—the three first without a wife, <br>While I have mine!

            "This was gruesome—fighting over a ham sandwich<br> with one of the tiny cats of Rome, he leaped<br> on my arm and half hung on to the food and half<br> hung on my shirt and coat. I tore it apart<br> and let him have his portion, I think I lifted him<br> down, sandwich and all, on the sidewalk and sat<br> with my own sandwich beside him, maybe I petted<br> his bony head and felt him shiver. I have<br> told this story over and over; some things<br> root in the mind; his boldness, of course, was frightening<br> and unexpected—his stubbornness—though hunger<br> drove him mad. It was the breaking of boundaries,<br> the sudden invasion, but not only that, it was<br> the sharing of food and the sharing of space; he didn’t<br> run into an alley or into a cellar,<br> he sat beside me, eating, and I didn’t run<br> into a trattoria, say, shaking,   <br> with food on my lips and blood on my cheek, sobbing;<br> but not only that, I had gone there to eat<br> and wait for someone. I had maybe an hour<br> before she would come and I was full of hope<br> and excitement. I have resisted for years<br> interpreting this, but now I think I was given<br> a clue, or I was giving myself a clue,<br> across the street from the glass sandwich shop.   <br> That was my last night with her, the next day<br> I would leave on the train for Paris and she would<br> meet her husband. Thirty-five years ago<br> I ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms, we were<br> dying together; we never met again<br> although she was pregnant when I left her—I have<br> a daughter or son somewhere, darling grandchildren   <br> in Norwich, Connecticut, or Canton, Ohio.<br> Every five years I think about her again<br> and plan on looking her up. The last time<br> I was sitting in New Brunswick, New Jersey,<br> and heard that her husband was teaching at Princeton,<br> if she was still married, or still alive, and tried   <br> calling. I went that far. We lived<br> in Florence and Rome. We rowed in the bay of Naples<br> and floated, naked, on the boards. I started<br> to think of her again today. I still<br> am horrified by that cat’s hunger. I still<br> am puzzled by the connection. This is another<br> insane devotion, there must be hundreds, although<br> it isn’t just that, there is no pain, and the thought<br> is fleeting and sweet. I think it’s my own dumb boyhood,<br> walking around with Slavic cheeks and burning<br> stupid eyes. I think I gave the cat<br> half of my sandwich to buy my life, I think<br> I broke it in half as a decent sacrifice.<br> It was this I bought, the red coleus,<br> the split rocking chair, the silk lampshade.<br> Happiness. I watched him with pleasure.   <br> I bought memory. I could have lost it.   <br> How crazy it sounds. His face twisted with cunning.<br> The wind blowing through his hair. His jaws working.<br><br>\n",

            "<br>The work has been going forward with the greatest difficulty, chiefly because I cannot concentrate. I have no feeling about whether what I am writing is good or bad, and the whole business is totally without excitement and pleasure for me. And I am sure I know the reason. It’s that I can’t stand leaving unresolved my situation with Pat. I hear from her fairly frequently, asking when I plan to come back, and she knows that I am supposed to appear at the poetry reading in the middle of January. It is not mainly loneliness I feel, though I feel it; but I have been lonely before. It is quite frankly the feeling that nothing is really settled between us, and that in the mean time I worry about how things are going to work out. This has made my work more difficult than it has ever been before.<br><br><em>– From a letter to his parents dated November 9, 1955, Rome.</em><br><br>Hardly enough for me that the pail of water<br>              Alive with the wrinkling light<br>              Brings clearness home and whiter<br>Than mind conceives the walls mature to white,<br>Or that the washed tomatoes whose name is given<br>              To love fulfill their bowl<br>              And the Roman sea is woven<br>Together by threading fish and made most whole.<br><br>I delight in each of these, delight moreover<br>              In the dark skill of those hands<br>              Closer to wise than clever<br>Of our blind Italian landlady who stands<br>Her shoes fouled with the lustful blood of rabbit<br>              Lightly dispatched and dressed<br>              Fixing it to the gibbet<br>Of the clothesline where the laundry sails to rest.<br><br>These textures solicit of us our instant homage<br>              But are disparate senseless things<br>              Unless a reigning image<br>Bring them to purpose as your presence brings<br>The world in offering, like a chaplet worn<br>              In Aphrodite’s name,<br>              The furious unicorn<br>Come to the virgin’s lap tethered and tame.<br><br>And thus it is as you stand in this morning’s shadows<br>              Where ancient chamber pots<br>              Are grown to little meadows<br>Of mint and parsley; surely it’s love unknots<br>The winds for Ulysses and recalls to man<br>              A summer without cease;<br>              Sprung from the same dishpan<br>Onion and lily work their primal peace.<br>\n",

Where will we go?<br> He walked me the half-block home<br> and kissed me goodnight on my stoop—<br> properly: not too quick, close enough<br> our stomachs pressed together<br> in a second sort of kiss.<br> I live next to a bar that's not a gay bar<br> —we just call those bars, I guess—<br> and because it is popular<br> and because I live on a busy street,<br> there are always people who aren't queer people<br> on the sidewalk on weekend nights.<br> Just people, I guess.<br> They were there last night.<br> As I kissed this man I was aware of them watching<br> and of myself wondering whether or not they were just.<br> But I didn't let myself feel scared, I kissed him<br> exactly as I wanted to, as I would have without an audience,<br> because I decided many years ago to refuse this fear—<br> an act of resistance. I left<br> the idea of hate out on the stoop and went inside,<br> to sleep, early and drunk and happy.<br> While I slept, a man went to a gay club<br> with two guns and killed forty-nine people.<br> Today in an interview, his father said he had been disturbed<br> recently by the sight of two men kissing.<br> What a strange power to be cursed with:<br> for the proof of men's desire to move men to violence.<br> What's a single kiss? I've had kisses<br> no one has ever known about, so many<br> kisses without consequence—<br> but there is a place you can't outrun,<br> whoever you are.<br> There will be a time when.<br> It might be a bullet, suddenly.<br> The sound of it. Many.<br> One man, two guns, fifty dead—<br> Two men kissing. Last night<br> I can't get away from, imagining it, them,<br> the people there to dance and laugh and drink,<br> who didn't believe they'd die, who couldn't have.<br> How else can you have a good time?<br> How else can you live?<br> There must have been two men kissing<br> for the first time last night, and for the last,<br> and two women, too, and two people who were neither.<br> Brown people, which cannot be a coincidence in this country<br> which is a racist country, which is gun country.<br> Today I'm thinking of the Bernie Boston photograph<br> Flower Power, of the Vietnam protestor placing carnations<br> in the rifles of the National Guard,<br> and wishing for a gesture as queer and simple.<br> The protester in the photo was gay, you know,<br> he went by Hibiscus and died of AIDS,<br> which I am also thinking about today because<br> (the government's response to) AIDS was a hate crime.<br> Now we have a president who names us,<br> the big and imperfectly lettered us, and here we are<br> getting kissed on stoops, getting married some of us,<br> some of us getting killed.<br> We must love one another whether or not we die.<br> Love can't block a bullet<br> but neither can it be shot down,<br> and love is, for the most part, what makes us—<br> in Orlando and in Brooklyn and in Kabul.<br> We will be everywhere, always;<br> there's nowhere else for us, or you, to go.<br> Anywhere you run in this world, love will be there to greet you.<br> Around any corner, there might be two men. Kissing.<br>  <br><br>\n",

            "<p>I like to feel like a Champion. Listening to Frankie Valli say \"I can't<br>take my eyes off of you\" I feel like New York City is a scale model in my<br>penthouse in North Carolina where I study economics, capital markets,<br>and the World Bank. I like to look into a scene from the top of a building in<br>my hometown down at the traders who are moving here from New York<br>City because New York City started to be kind of like a losing place for<br>wealth creation. Now I look down on them and say to myself \"I'm too big<br>to fail.\" I take my keys off of the ledge and walk down the condominium<br>tower overlooking the entire city. When I reach the parking deck I open<br>the door of a 1980 Mercedes Benz 450 SL and coast to a place called High<br>Street. I'm at High Street knocking back a gin and tonic with three girls<br>I met at the Arts &amp; Technology Center conference on the decline of the<br>book. We have a laugh about the old guard who make a book bound in<br>glue and then pinch angel dust off our palms. At this point I'm so high I'm<br>like, look, why don't we excuse ourselves and go up to my condominium<br>tower I've just invested 3.5 million dollars in. They are like uh, we can do<br>that. So we pile into my 450 SL and ride to the tower listening to the music<br>of Frankie Valli transform our night into a piece of artwork. Nearly there,<br>I look around at the Arts &amp; Technology girls and sort of hum to myself.<br>I feel like I've hit a milestone in my evening when we trip into the foyer<br>of my massive penthouse that has those gleaming glass cubes set into the<br>wall you see in Miami or Miami Beach. From the cubes a glimmer of the<br>prosperity circling this region pierces the dark in the form of an orange-<br>yellow beam of fluorescent light. One of the girls is removing her jewelry<br>and I'm like no, don't. She takes off her clothes instead and lies face down<br>on the carpet. At the stereo I play a song by Frankie Valli. The other two<br>are kind of standing around surprised, I think, by the curtain of paperback<br>books lining the north wall. Those are only bound books I tell them<br>while I finger the Kindle on my coffee table. It is the new large Kindle<br>and we are looking at a book called <em>Boredom</em> by Alberto Moravia, taking<br>turns reading passages from the screen. When we get to the part when<br>the boho girl is fucking the protagonist the totally white breast of one of<br>the Arts &amp; Technology girls slips coolly from her blouse. Pretending not<br>to notice I continue to read in my turn. The girl sitting on the other side<br>of me is wearing some totally white string of pearls and she's removing<br>everything but the pearls. I continue to read the screen while the Arts<br>&amp; Technology girls start to make out like I had been planning for them<br>to do ever since we licked angel dust off each other's palms. I get up and<br>go to the stereo, set the needle back to the gold record \"Can't Take My<br>Eyes Off You,\" and walk calmly to the sofa. Once I'm there I melt into the<br>sand-rubbed upholstery with the Arts &amp; Technology girls who haven't<br>yet passed out on the floor. While I'm lying with my back to the armrest<br>I glimpse a piece of sky I've seen only in films of the old grain. It's a wild<br>purple darkness with a bright white hole in it. I'm thinking to myself<br>God, my personal Jesus Christ and saviour, I want you to come down<br>here through that hole in the night and join me in Eden.</p>\n",

<br>Chill August, pale September, <br>      Endured a woful while, <br>And fell as falls an ember <br>      From forth a flameless pile: <br>But golden-girt November <br>      Bids all she looks on smile. <br><br>The lustrous foliage, waning <br>      As wanes the morning moon, <br>Here falling, here refraining, <br>      Outbraves the pride of June <br>With statelier semblance, feigning <br>      No fear lest death be soon: <br>As though the woods thus waning <br>      Should wax to meet the moon. <br><br>As though, when fields lie stricken <br>      By grey December's breath, <br>These lordlier growths that sicken <br>      And die for fear of death <br>Should feel the sense requicken <br>      That hears what springtide saith <br>And thrills for love, spring-stricken <br>      And pierced with April's breath. <br><br>The keen white-winged north-easter <br>      That stings and spurs thy sea <br>Doth yet but feed and feast her <br>      With glowing sense of glee: <br>Calm chained her, storm released her, <br>      And storm's glad voice was he: <br>South-wester or north-easter, <br>      Thy winds rejoice the sea. <br><br>V <br>A dream, a dream is it all — the season, <br>      The sky, the water, the wind, the shore? <br>A day-born dream of divine unreason, <br>      A marvel moulded of sleep — no more? <br>For the cloudlike wave that my limbs while cleaving <br>Feel as in slumber beneath them heaving <br>Soothes the sense as to slumber, leaving <br>      Sense of nought that was known of yore. <br><br>A purer passion, a lordlier leisure, <br>      A peace more happy than lives on land, <br>Fulfils with pulse of diviner pleasure <br>      The dreaming head and the steering hand. <br>I lean my cheek to the cold grey pillow, <br>The deep soft swell of the full broad billow, <br>And close mine eyes for delight past measure, <br>      And wish the wheel of the world would stand. <br><br>The wild-winged hour that we fain would capture <br>      Falls as from heaven that its light feet clomb, <br>So brief, so soft, and so full the rapture <br>      Was felt that soothed me with sense of home. <br>To sleep, to swim, and to dream, for ever — <br>Such joy the vision of man saw never; <br>For here too soon will a dark day sever <br>      The sea-bird's wing from the sea-wave's foam. <br><br>A dream, and more than a dream, and dimmer <br>      At once and brighter than dreams that flee, <br>The moment's joy of the seaward swimmer <br>      Abides, remembered as truth may be. <br>Not all the joy and not all the glory <br>Must fade as leaves when the woods wax hoary; <br>For there the downs and the sea-banks glimmer, <br>      And here to south of them swells the sea. <br><br><br>\n",

He is trying to reach<br> the bees, he is after bees. This is the climax, an end<br> to two summers of small operations with sprays and ladders.<br><br> Last June on the porch floor I found them dead,<br> a sprinkle of dusty bugs, and next day a still worse<br> death, until, like falling in love, bee-haunted,<br> I swept up bigger and bigger loads of some hatch,<br> I thought, sickened, and sickening me, from what origin?<br><br> My life centered on bees, all floors were suspect. The search<br> was hopeless. Windows were shut. I never find<br> where anything comes from. But in June my husband’s fierce<br> sallies began, inspections, cracks located<br> and sealed, insecticides shot; outside, the bees’ course<br>  <br> watched, charted; books on bees read.<br> I tell you I swept up bodies every day on the porch.<br> Then they’d stop, the problem was solved; then they were there again,<br> as the feelings make themselves known again, as they beseech<br> sleepers who live innocently in will and mind.<br>  <br> It is no surprise to those who walk with their tigers<br> that the bees were back, no surprise to me. But they had<br> left themselves so lack-luster, their black and gold furs<br> so deathly faded. Gray bugs that the broom hunted<br> were like a thousand little stops when some great lurch<br>  <br> of heart takes place, or a great shift of season.<br> November it came to an end. No bees. And I could watch<br> the floor, clean and cool, and, from windows, the cold land.<br> But this spring the thing began again, and his curse<br> went upstairs again, and his tinkering and reasoning and pride.<br>  <br> It is the man who takes hold. I lived from bees, but his force<br> went out after bees and found them in the wall where they hid.<br> And now in July he is tearing out the wall, and each<br> board ripped brings them closer to his hunting hand.<br> It is quiet, has been quiet for a while. He calls me, and I march<br>  <br> from a dream of bees to see them, winged and unwinged,<br> such a mess of interrupted life dumped on newspapers—<br> dirty clots of grubs, sawdust, stuck fliers, all smeared<br> together with old honey, they writhe, some of them, but who cares?<br> They go to the garbage, it is over, everything has been said.<br>  <br> But there is more. Wouldn’t you think the bees had suffered<br> enough? This evening we go to a party, the breeze<br> dies, late, we are sticky in our old friendships and light-headed.<br> We tell our funny story about the bees.<br> At two in the morning we come home, and a friend,<br>  <br> a scientist, comes with us, in his car. We’re going to save<br> the idea of the thing, a hundred bees, if we can find<br> so many unrotted, still warm but harmless, and leave<br> the rest. We hope that the neighbors are safe in bed,<br> taking no note of these private catastrophes.<br>  <br> He wants an enzyme in the flight-wing muscle. Not a bad<br> thing to look into. In the night we rattle and raise<br> the lid of the garbage can. Flashlights in hand,<br> we open newspapers, and the men reach in a salve<br> of happenings. I can’t touch it. I hate the self-examined<br>  <br> who’ve killed the self. The dead are darker, but the others have<br> moved in the ooze toward the next moment. My God<br> one half-worm gets its wings right before our eyes.<br> Searching fingers sort and lay bare, they need<br> the idea of bees—and yet, under their touch, the craze<br>  <br> for life gets stronger in the squirming, whitish kind.<br> The men do it. Making a claim on the future, as love<br> makes a claim on the future, grasping. And I, underhand,<br> I feel it start, a terrible, lifelong heave<br> taking direction. Unpleading, the men prod<br>  <br> till all that grubby softness wants to give, <em>to give.</em><br><br>\n",
